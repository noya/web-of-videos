00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.040
OK, here's the last lecture in
the chapter on orthogonality.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.409
So we met orthogonal
vectors, two vectors,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:38.030
we met orthogonal subspaces,
like the row space and null

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.090
space.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.220
Now today we meet
an orthogonal basis,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.870
and an orthogonal matrix.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.420
So we really --

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.670
this chapter cleans
up orthogonality.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.430
And really I want --

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.380
I should use the
word orthonormal.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:07.190
Orthogonal is -- so my
vectors are q1,q2 up to qn --

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.680
I use the letter "q",
here, to remind me,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.770
I'm talking about orthogonal
things, not just any vectors,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.190
but orthogonal ones.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.730
So what does that mean?

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.100
That means that every q is
orthogonal to every other q.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.380
It's a natural idea,
to have a basis that's

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.560
headed off at
ninety-degree angles,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.620
the inner products are all zero.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.760
Of course if q is -- certainly
qi is not orthogonal to itself.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.700
But there we'll make
the best choice again,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550
make it a unit vector.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.110
Then qi transpose qi is
one, for a unit vector.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.090
The length squared is one.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.930
And that's what I would
use the word normal.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.980
So for this part, normalized,
unit length for this part.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.480
OK.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.620
So first part of
the lecture is how

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.820
does having an orthonormal
basis make things nice?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.830
It certainly does.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.990
It makes all the
calculations better,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.650
a whole lot of
numerical linear algebra

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.020
is built around working
with orthonormal vectors,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.730
because they never
get out of hand,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.720
they never overflow
or underflow.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.890
And I'll put them
into a matrix Q,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.930
and then the second
part of the lecture

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.130
will be suppose my
basis, my columns of A

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.210
are not orthonormal.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.160
How do I make them so?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.610
And the two names associated
with that simple idea

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.340
are Graham and Schmidt.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.910
So the first part is we've
got a basis like this.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.540
Let's put those into
the columns of a matrix.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.490
So a matrix Q that has --

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.180
I'll put these
orthonormal vectors,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.150
q1 will be the first column,
qn will be the n-th column.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.110
And I want to say, I want
to write this property,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.390
qi transpose qj
being zero, I want

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.140
to put that in a matrix form.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.890
And just the right thing is
to look at Q transpose Q.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.020
So this chapter has been
looking at A transpose A.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.970
So it's natural to
look at Q transpose Q.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.990
And the beauty is it
comes out perfectly.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.660
Because Q transpose has
these vectors in its rows,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.010
the first row is q1 transpose,
the nth row is qn transpose.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.570
So that's Q transpose.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.110
And now I want to multiply by Q.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.310
That has q1 along to
qn in the columns.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.930
That's Q.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.910
And what do I get?

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.740
You really -- this is the
first simplest most basic fact,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.430
that how do orthonormal
vectors, orthonormal columns

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.160
in a matrix, what happens
if I compute Q transpose Q?

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.350
Do you see it?

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.560
If I take the first row
times the first column,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.670
what do I get?

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.180
A one.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.070
If I take the first row
times the second column,

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.830
what do I get?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.780
Zero.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.670
That's the orthogonality.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.960
The first row times the
last column is zero.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.130
And so I'm getting
ones on the diagonal

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.120
and I'm getting zeroes
everywhere else.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.580
I'm getting the identity matrix.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.420
You see how that's -- it's
just like the right calculation

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.240
to do.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.040
If you have orthonormal
columns, and the matrix

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.920
doesn't have to be square here.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.790
We might have just two columns.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.170
And they might have
four, lots of components.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.870
So but they're orthonormal, and
when we do Q transpose times Q,

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.610
that Q transpose times
Q or A transpose A

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.180
just asks for all
those dot products.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.030
Rows times columns.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.890
And in this orthonormal case,
we get the best possible answer,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.350
the identity.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.830
OK, so this is --

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.190
so I mean now we have a new
bunch of important matrices.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.570
What have we seen previously?

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.940
We've seen in the
distant past we

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.680
had triangular matrices,
diagonal matrices, permutation

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.260
matrices, that was
early chapters,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.690
then we had row echelon
forms, then in this chapter

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.400
we've already seen
projection matrices,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.330
and now we're seeing this
new class of matrices

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.990
with orthonormal columns.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.010
That's a very long expression.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.520
I sorry that I can't just
call them orthogonal matrices.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.590
But that word
orthogonal matrices --

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.940
or maybe I should be able to
call it orthonormal matrices,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.590
why don't we call
it orthonormal --

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.790
I mean that would be an
absolutely perfect name.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.360
For Q, call it an
orthonormal matrix

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.870
because its columns
are orthonormal.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.770
OK, but the convention is
that we only use that name

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.430
orthogonal matrix,
we only use this --

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.170
this word orthogonal,
we don't even

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.450
say orthonormal for
some unknown reason,

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.035
matrix when it's square.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.240
So in the case when this is a
square matrix, that's the case

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.330
we call it an orthogonal matrix.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.790
And what's special about
the case when it's square?

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:34.890
When it's a square matrix,
we've got its inverse, so --

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:49.350
so in the case if Q is square,
then Q transpose Q equals I

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.230
tells us --

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.320
let me write that underneath --

00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:03.170
tells us that Q
transpose is Q inverse.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.500
There we have the
easy to remember

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:12.940
property for a square matrix
with orthonormal columns.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.460
That -- I need to write
some examples down.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.680
Let's see.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.250
Some examples like if I
take any -- so examples,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.220
let's do some examples.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.330
Any permutation matrix,
let me take just

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.860
some random permutation matrix.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:39.419
Permutation Q equals let's say
oh, make it three by three,

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:45.550
say zero, zero, one, one,
zero, zero, zero, one, zero.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.050
OK.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:57.360
That certainly has unit
vectors in its columns.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.440
Those vectors are certainly
perpendicular to each other.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.200
And if I -- and so that's it.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.940
That makes it a Q.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.860
And -- if I took its transpose,
if I multiplied by Q transpose,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.140
shall I do that -- and let
me stick in Q transpose

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.900
here.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.490
Just to do that
multiplication once more,

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.700
transpose it'll put the --

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.220
make that into a column,
make that into a column,

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.420
make that into a column.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.700
And the transpose is also --

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.190
another Q.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.570
Another orthonormal matrix.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.610
And when I multiply that
product I get I. OK,

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.390
so there's an example.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.360
And actually there's
a second example.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.920
But those are real
easy examples, right,

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.280
I mean to get orthogonal
columns by just

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:56.130
putting ones in different
places is like too easy.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.530
So let me keep
going with examples.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.670
So here's another
simple example.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.670
Cos theta sine theta,
there's a unit vector,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.420
oh, let me even
take it, well, yeah.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.000
Cos theta sine theta
and now the other way

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.290
I want sine theta cos theta.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.200
But I want the inner
product to be zero.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.650
And if I put a minus
there, it'll do it.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.260
So that's -- unit vector,
that's a unit vector.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.420
And if I take the dot product,
I get minus plus zero.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.470
OK.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:42.730
For example Q equals say
one, one, one, minus one,

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.210
is that an orthogonal matrix?

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.100
I've got orthogonal
columns there,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.420
but it's not quite
an orthogonal matrix.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.500
How shall I fix it to
be an orthogonal matrix?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.280
Well, what's the length
of those column vectors,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.040
the dot product with themselves
is -- right now it's two,

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.260
right, the --

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.540
the length squared.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.216
The length squared would be
one plus one would be two,

00:11:13.216 --> 00:11:14.840
the length would be
square root of two,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.290
so I better divide by
square root of two.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.250
OK.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.580
So there's a -- there now I
have got an orthogonal matrix,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.850
in fact, it's this one --
when theta is pi over four.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.710
The cosines and
well almost, I guess

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.110
the minus sine is down
there, so maybe, I

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.151
don't know, maybe minus
pi over four or something.

00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:39.650
OK.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
Let me do one
final example, just

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.500
to show that you
can get bigger ones.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.770
Q equals let me take that
matrix up in the corner

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.330
and I'll sort of
repeat that pattern,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.510
repeat it again, and
then minus it down here.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:13.300
That's one of the world's
favorite orthogonal matrices.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.590
I hope I got it right, is --

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.000
can you see whether --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.390
if I take the inner product of
one column with another one,

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.490
let's see, if I take
the inner product

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.570
of that column with that I have
two minuses and two pluses,

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.460
that's good.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.780
When I take the inner
product of that with that

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.891
I have a plus and a
minus, a minus and a plus.

00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:33.390
Good.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.030
I think it all works out.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.710
And what do I have
to divide by now?

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.005
To make those into unit vectors.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:50.020
Right now the vector one,
one, one, one has length two.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.160
Square root of four.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.180
So I have to divide by two
to make it unit vector,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.690
so there's another.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.050
That's my entire array
of simple examples.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:12.110
This construction is named after
a guy called Adhemar and we

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:18.460
know how to do it for
two, four, sixteen,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:26.170
sixty-four and so on, but we --
nobody knows exactly which size

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.470
matrices have --

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.750
which size -- which sizes allow
orthogonal matrices of ones

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.800
and minus ones.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.950
So Adhemar matrix is an
orthogonal matrix that's got

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:45.570
ones and minus ones, and a
lot of ones -- some we know,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.630
some other sizes, there couldn't
be a five by five I think.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.470
But there are some
sizes that nobody

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:57.720
yet knows whether there could be
or can't be a matrix like that.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.660
OK.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.360
You see those
orthogonal matrices.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:10.410
Now let me ask what -- why
is it good to have orthogonal

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.550
matrices?

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.330
What calculation is made easy?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.540
If I have an orthogonal matrix.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.160
And -- let me remember that the
matrix could be rectangular.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.380
Shall I put down --

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.180
I better put a
rectangular example down.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.770
So the -- these were
all square examples.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.410
Can I put down just --

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.690
a rectangular one
just to be sure

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.580
that we realize that
this is possible.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.430
let's help me out.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:49.370
Let's see, if I put like a
one, two, two and a minus two,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.135
minus one, two.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.840
That's -- a matrix -- oh its
columns aren't normalized yet.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.450
I always have to
remember to do that.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.090
I always do that last
because it's easy to do.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.960
What's the length
of those columns?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.920
So if I wanted them -- if I
wanted them to be length one,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.340
I should divide by their
length, which is --

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.940
so I'd look at one squared plus
two squared plus two squared,

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.920
that's one and four
and four is nine,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.920
so I take the square root and
I need to divide by three.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.420
OK.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.280
So there is --

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.820
well, without that, I've
got one orthonormal vector.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.560
I mean just one unit vector.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.630
Now put that guy in.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.730
Now I have a basis
for the column

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:50.480
space for a two-dimensional
space, an orthonormal basis,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.000
right?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.640
These two columns
are orthonormal,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.160
they would be an
orthonormal basis

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.690
for this two-dimensional
space that they span.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.200
Orthonormal vectors by the way
have got to be independent.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.410
It's easy to show that
orthonormal vectors

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.140
since they're headed off
all at ninety degrees

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.130
there's no combination
that gives zero.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:22.470
Now if I wanted to
create now a third one,

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:28.720
I could either just put in
some third vector that was

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.300
independent and go to this
Graham-Schmidt calculation that

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.360
I'm going to explain, or I
could be inspired and say look,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.490
that -- with that pattern,
why not put a one in there,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.150
and a two in there,
and a two in there,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.760
and try to fix up the
signs so that they worked.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.570
Hmm.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.750
I don't know if I've done
this too brilliantly.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.730
Let's see, what
signs, that's minus,

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:04.770
maybe I'd make a minus sign
there, how would that be?

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.490
Yeah, maybe that works.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:15.670
I think that those three columns
are orthonormal and they --

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.220
the beauty of this -- this is
the last example I'll probably

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.599
find where there's no
square root, the --

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.750
the punishing thing
in Graham-Schmidt,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.220
maybe we better know
that in advance,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:35.450
is that because I want these
vectors to be unit vectors,

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.400
I'm always running
into square roots.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.770
I'm always dividing by lengths.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.610
And those lengths
are square roots.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:45.400
So you'll see as soon as I
do a Graham-Schmidt example,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.690
square roots are
going to show up.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.460
But here are some
examples where we did it

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.350
without any square root.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.160
OK.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.400
OK.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.610
So -- so great.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:06.260
Now next question is what's
the good of having a Q?

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.360
What formulas become easier?

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.040
Suppose I want to
project, so suppose Q --

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.510
suppose Q has
orthonormal columns.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.650
I'm using the letter
Q to mean this,

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.630
I'll write it this
one more time,

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.620
but I always mean
when I write a Q,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.410
I always mean that it
has orthonormal columns.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:41.415
So suppose I want to project
onto its column space.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.670
So what's the projection matrix?

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.260
What's the projection matrix is
I project onto a column space?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.810
OK, that gives me a chance to
review the projection section,

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.270
including that big formula,
which used to be --

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.080
those four As in a
row, but now it's

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.850
got Qs, because I'm projecting
onto the column space of Q,

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.280
so do you remember what it was?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:21.200
It's Q Q transpose Q
inverse Q transpose.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.890
That's my four Qs in a row.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.190
But what's good here?

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:36.540
What -- what makes this formula
nice if I'm projecting onto

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.160
a column space when I have
orthonormal basis for that

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.940
space?

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.610
What makes it nice is
this is the identity.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.860
I don't have to
do any inversion.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.690
I just get Q Q transpose.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.750
So Q Q transpose is
a projection matrix.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.090
Oh, I can't help --

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.470
I can't resist just
checking the properties,

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:08.140
what are the properties
of a projection matrix?

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.780
There are two properties to
know for any projection matrix.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.060
And I'm saying that this
is the right projection

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.000
matrix when we've got
this orthonormal basis

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.480
in the columns.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.040
OK.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.150
So there's the
projection matrix.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.170
Suppose the matrix is square.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.590
First just tell me
first this extreme case.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:37.690
If my matrix is square and it's
got these orthonormal columns,

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.670
then what's the column space?

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.770
If I have a square matrix and
I have independent columns,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.450
and even orthonormal columns,
then the column space

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.670
is the whole space, right?

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:56.750
And what's the projection
matrix onto the whole space?

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.290
The identity matrix.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.860
If I'm projecting
in the whole space,

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.190
every vector B is right
where it's supposed to be

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.310
and I don't have to
move it by projection.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:13.300
So this would be --

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.890
I'll put in parentheses
this is I if Q is square.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.860
Well that we said that already.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.490
If Q is square, that's the case
where Q transpose is Q inverse,

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.640
we can put it on the right,
we can put it on the left,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.500
we always get the identity
matrix, if it's square.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:44.570
But if it's not a square
matrix then it's not --

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:48.010
we don't get the
identity matrix.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:53.210
We have Q Q transpose,
and just again

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.550
what are those two properties
of a projection matrix?

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.900
First of all, it's symmetric.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:04.370
OK, no problem, that's
certainly a symmetric So what's

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.360
that second property
of a projection?

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:06.860
matrix.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.510
That if you project and project
again you don't move the second

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.260
time.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.720
So the other property
of a projection matrix

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.570
should be that Q
Q transpose twice

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.820
should be the same as
Q Q transpose once.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.050
That's projection matrices.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.670
And that property
better fall out

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:34.040
right away because
from the fact we

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.560
know about orthonormal matrices,
Q transpose Q is I. OK,

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.510
you see it.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:45.820
In the middle here is sitting
Q Q t- Q transpose Q, sorry,

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.530
that's what I meant to
say, Q transpose Q is I.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.500
So that's sitting right in
the middle, that cancels out,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.260
to give the identity, we're
left with one Q Q transpose,

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.980
and we're all set.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.680
OK.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.340
So this is the
projection matrix --

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:10.170
all the equation -- all the
messy equations of this chapter

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.870
become trivial
when our matrix --

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.040
when we have this
orthonormal basis.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.130
I mean what do I mean
by all the equations?

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.780
Well, the most
important equation

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:26.180
was the normal equation, do
you remember old A transpose

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:31.120
A x hat equals A transpose b?

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.700
But now -- now A is Q.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:43.640
Now I'm thinking I have
Q transpose Q X hat

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.500
equals Q transpose b.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.780
And what's good about that?

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:58.450
What's good is that matrix on
the left side is the identity.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.610
The matrix on the left is
the identity, Q transpose Q,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.010
normally it isn't, normally it's
that matrix of inner products

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.370
and you've to compute all those
dopey inner products and --

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.530
and -- and solve the system.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.450
Here the inner products
are all one or zero.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.040
This is the identity matrix.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.780
It's gone.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.410
And there's the answer.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.640
There's no inversion involved.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:31.230
Each component of
x is a Q times b.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:36.740
What that equation is saying
is that the i-th component is

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:41.920
the i-th basis vector times b.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:50.260
That's -- probably the most
important formula in some major

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:56.220
parts of mathematics, that
if we have orthonormal basis,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:03.160
then the component in the --
in the i-th, along the i-th --

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:10.130
the projection on the i-th basis
vector is just qi transpose b.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:16.080
That number x that we look
for is just a dot product.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.580
OK.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:25.540
OK, so I'm ready now for
the sort of like second half

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.030
of the lecture.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.820
Where we don't start with
an orthogonal matrix,

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.410
orthonormal vectors.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.110
We just start with
independent vectors

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.870
and we want to make
them orthonormal.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.360
So I'm going to --
can I do that now?

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.440
Now here comes Graham-Schmidt.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.990
So -- Graham-Schmidt.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.490
So this is a calculation,
I won't say --

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:08.690
I can't quite say it's like
elimination, because it's

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.130
different, our goal
isn't triangular anymore.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.280
With elimination our goal was
make the matrix triangular.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.700
Now our goal is make
the matrix orthogonal.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.080
Make those columns orthonormal.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.740
So let me start
with two columns.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.505
So I start with vectors a and b.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.930
And they're just like --
here, let me draw them.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.280
Here's a.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:38.905
Here's b.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.080
For example.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.200
A isn't specially
horizontal, wasn't

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.650
meant to be, just a is
one vector, b is another.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.540
I want to produce
those two vectors,

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.260
they might be in
twelve-dimensional space,

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.440
or they might be in
two-dimensional space.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.800
They're independent, anyway.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.000
So I better be sure I say that.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.830
I start with
independent vectors.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.000
And I want to produce
out of that q 1 and q2,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.470
I want to produce
orthonormal vectors.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:25.230
And Graham and
Schmidt tell me how.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.760
OK.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.830
Well, actually you could tell me
how, we don't need -- frankly,

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:33.300
I don't know -- there's
only one idea here,

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:40.350
if Graham had the idea, I
don't know what Schmidt did.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.640
But OK.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.970
So you'll see it.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.400
We don't need either
of them, actually.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.130
OK, so what I going to do.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.130
I'll take that --
this first guy.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.470
OK.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.290
Well, he's fine.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.120
That direction is fine except --

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.800
yeah, I'll say OK, I'll
settle for that direction.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.910
So I'm going to --

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.130
I'm going to get, so
what I going to --

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:14.870
my goal is I'm going to
get orthogonal vectors

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.280
and I'll call those
capital A and B.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.090
So that's the key step is
to get from any two vectors

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.930
to two orthogonal vectors.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:30.030
And then at the end, no problem,
I'll get orthonormal vectors,

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:36.130
how will -- what will those
will be my qs, q1 and q2,

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:36.950
and what will they

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:37.450
be?

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.770
Once I've got A and B
orthogonal, well, look,

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:50.890
it's no big deal -- maybe
that's what Schmidt did, he,

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.340
brilliant Schmidt, thought
OK, divide by the length,

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.810
all right.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.325
That's Schmidt's contribution.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.640
OK.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:11.120
But Graham had a little
more thinking to do, right?

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.280
We haven't done Graham's part.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.550
This part except OK,
I'm happy with A,

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:22.670
A can be A. That first
direction is fine.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.120
Why should -- no
complaint about that.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.120
The trouble is the second
direction is not fine.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.670
Because it's not
orthogonal to the first.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:39.210
I'm looking for a vector
that's -- starts with B,

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:45.050
but makes it orthogonal to A.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.480
What's the vector?

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.370
How do I do that?

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.460
How do I produce
from this vector

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:57.320
a piece that's
orthogonal to this one?

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.400
And the -- remember these
vectors might be in two

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.070
dimensions or they might
be in twelve dimensions.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.710
I'm just looking for the idea.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.340
So what's the idea?

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.610
Where did we have orthogonal --

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.940
a vector showing up that
was orthogonal to this guy?

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.490
Well, that was the
first basic calculation

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.280
of the whole chapter.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.350
We -- we did a projection and
the projection gave us this

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:31.390
part, which was the
part in the A direction.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.000
Now, the part we want is
the other part, the e part.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.550
This part.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.290
This is going to be our --

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.950
that guy is that guy.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:46.610
This is our vector B. That gives
us that ninety-degree angle.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.740
So B is you could say --

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.230
B is really what we
previously called

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.640
e.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.560
The error vector.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.450
And what is it?

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.450
I mean what do I
-- what is B here?

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.190
A is A, no problem.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.910
B is --

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.620
OK, what's this error piece?

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.030
Do you remember?

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:19.650
It's I start with the original
B and I take away what?

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:24.170
Its projection, this P.
This -- the vector B,

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.660
this error vector, is the
original vector removing

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.390
the projection.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.090
So instead of wanting
the projection,

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.760
now that's what I
want to throw away.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.280
I want to get the part
that's perpendicular.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.220
And there will be a
perpendicular part,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.955
it won't be zero.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:48.380
Because these vectors
were independent, so B --

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.380
if B was along the
direction of A,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.330
then if the original B and A
were in the same direction,

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.260
then I'm --

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.000
I've only got one direction.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.940
But here they're in two
independent directions

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.690
and all I'm doing
is getting that guy.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:05.050
So what's its formula?

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:09.010
What's the formula
for that if --

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.040
I want to subtract
the projection,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.950
so do you remember
the projection?

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:18.990
It's some multiple of A
and what's that multiple?

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.530
It's -- it's that thing we
called x in the very very first

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.650
lecture on this chapter.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:32.040
There's an A transpose
A in the bottom

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:39.495
and there's an A transpose
B, isn't that it?

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.740
I think that's Graham's formula.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.800
Or Graham-Schmidt.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.100
No, that's Graham.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.620
Schmidt has got to divide the
whole thing by the length,

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.160
so he --

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.780
his formula makes a mess which
I'm not willing to write down.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.570
So let's just see that
what I saying here?

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:07.170
I'm saying that this vector
is perpendicular to A.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.760
That these are orthogonal.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.210
A is perpendicular to B.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.990
Can you check that?

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.930
How do you see that
yes, of course, we --

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.660
our picture is telling
us, yes, we did it right.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:24.224
How would I check that this
matrix is perpendicular to A?

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:32.240
I would multiply by A transpose
and I better get zero, right?

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.910
I should check that.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:38.430
A transpose B should
come out zero.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.420
So this is A transpose times
-- now what did we say B was?

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.870
We start with the original
B, and we take away

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:53.590
this projection, and that
should come out zero.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.450
Well, here we get an
A transpose B minus --

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.550
and here is another A
transpose B, and the --

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.620
and it's an A transpose A
over A transpose A, a one,

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.340
those cancel, and
we do get zero.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:09.840
Right.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:21.449
Now I guess I can
do numbers in there.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:24.920
But I have to take
a third vector

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.830
to be sure we've got
this system down.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:35.750
So now I have to say if I have
independent vectors A, B and C,

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:41.320
I'm looking for orthogonal
vectors A, B and capital C,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.670
and then of course the
third guy will just

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.479
be C over its length,
the unit vector.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.489
So this is now the problem.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.430
I got B here.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.390
I got A very easily.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:08.110
And now -- if you see the idea,
we could figure out a formula

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:16.890
for C. So now that -- so this
is like a typical homework quiz

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:17.650
problem.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.760
I give you two vectors, you do
this, I give you three vectors,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.960
and you have to make
them orthonormal.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.020
So you do this again,
the first vector's fine,

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:32.660
the second vector is
perpendicular to the first,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.220
and now I need a
third vector that's

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.740
perpendicular to the first
one and the second one.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.060
Right?

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:45.160
Tthis is the end of a -- the
lecture is to find this guy.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.480
Find this vector -- this vector
C, that's perpendicular we n-

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.910
at this point we know A and B.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:36:00.040
But C, the little c that
we're given, is off in some --

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.530
it's got to come out of the
blackboard to be independent,

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.949
so -- so can I sort of draw
off -- off comes a c somewhere.

00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:09.740
I don't know, where I
going to put the darn

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.550
thing?

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.950
Maybe I'll put it
off, oh, I don't know,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.660
like that somehow, C, little c.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.430
And I already know that
perpendicular direction,

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.250
that one and that one.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.300
So now what's the idea?

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.580
Give me the Graham-Schmidt
formula for C.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.200
What is this C here?

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.020
Equals what?

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.660
What I going to do?

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.800
I'll start with the given one.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.230
As before.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.780
Right?

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.910
I start with the
vector I'm given.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.900
And what do I do with it?

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.560
I want to remove out of
it, I want to subtract off,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.010
so I'll put a minus sign
in, I want to subtract off

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:08.510
its components in the A, capital
A and capital B directions.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.350
I just want to get
those out of there.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.790
Well, I know how to do that.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.210
I did it with B.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.910
So I'll just -- so
let me take away --

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:18.940
what if I do this?

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.350
What have I done?

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.020
I've got little c and what
have I subtracted from it?

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:37.780
Its component, its projection
if you like, in the A direction.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:46.320
And now I've got to subtract
off its component B transpose

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.700
C over B transpose B,
that multiple of B,

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.075
is its component
in the B direction.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:02.980
And that gives me the vector
capital C that if anything is

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.660
--

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:10.200
if there's any justice, this
C should be perpendicular to A

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.250
and it should be
perpendicular to B.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:18.160
And the only thing it's --
hasn't got is unit vector,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.330
so we divide by its
length to get that too.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.890
OK.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:30.440
Let me do an example.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.910
Can I --

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:36.490
I'll make my life easy,
I'll just take two vectors.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.380
So let me do a
numerical example.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.980
If I'll give you
two vectors, you

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.720
give me back the Graham-Schmidt
orthonormal basis,

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.490
and we'll see how to
express that in matrix form.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.030
OK.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:56.580
So let me give you
the two vectors.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.920
So I'll take the vector A
equals let's say one, one, one,

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.410
why not?

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:11.316
And B equals let's say
one, zero, two, OK?

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.800
I didn't want to cheat
and make them orthogonal

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.830
in the first place because
then Graham-Schmidt

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:23.931
wouldn't be needed.

00:39:23.931 --> 00:39:24.430
OK.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.260
So those are not orthogonal.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.830
So what is capital A?

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.780
Well that's the same as big A.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.850
That was fine.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:34.090
What's B?

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.100
So B is this b --
is the original B,

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:45.180
and then I subtract off
some multiple of the A.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.400
And what's the multiple?

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:52.020
What goes in here?

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:56.740
B -- here's the A -- this is
the -- this is the little b,

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.930
this is the big A, also
the little a, and I want

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.180
to multiply it by that
right -- that right ratio,

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.980
which has A transpose
A, here's my ratio.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.600
I'm just doing this.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.110
So it's A transpose B,
what is A transpose B,

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.290
it looks like three.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:22.280
And what is A -- oh, my --

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.971
what's A transpose A?

00:40:23.971 --> 00:40:24.470
Three.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.190
I'm sorry.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:30.490
I didn't know that
was going to happen.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:30.990
OK.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.940
But it happened.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.250
Why should we knock it?

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:35.110
OK.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.930
So do you see it all right?

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.540
That's A transpose B,
there's A transpose A, that's

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.140
the fraction, so
I take this away,

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:49.140
and I get one take away one
is a zero, zero minus this one

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:54.680
is a minus one, and two
minus the one is a one.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.430
OK.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.830
And what's this vector
that we finally found?

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:02.520
This is B.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.080
And how do I know it's right?

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.190
How do I know I've
got a vector I want?

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:13.200
I check that B is
perpendicular to --

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.480
that A and B are perpendicular.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.780
That A is perpendicular to B.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.690
Just look at that.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.050
That one -- the dot product
of that with that is zero.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:22.680
OK.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.355
So now what is my q1 and q2?

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.200
Why don't I put
them in a matrix?

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:33.980
Of course.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.470
Since I'm always putting
these -- so the Q,

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.760
I'll put the q1 and
the q2 in a matrix.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.220
And what are they?

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:48.200
Now when I'm writing
q-s I'm supposed

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.700
to make things normalized.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.950
I'm supposed to make
things unit vectors.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.240
So I'm going to take that A
but I'm going to divide it

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.150
by square root of three.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.280
And I'm going to
take this B but I'm

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.870
going to divide it
by square root of two

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:13.226
to make it a unit vector,
and there is my matrix.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.930
That's my matrix with
orthonormal columns coming from

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.290
Graham-Schmidt and
it sort of it --

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:30.240
it came from the original
one, one, one, one, zero, two,

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:30.740
right?

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.120
That was my original guys.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.700
These were the two
I started with.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.450
These are the two that
I'm happy to end with.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:45.610
Because those are orthonormal.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.990
So that's what
Graham-Schmidt did.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:53.550
It -- well, tell me about
the column spaces of these

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.760
matrices.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.680
How is the column space of Q
related to the column space of

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.400
A?

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.650
So I'm always asking
you things like this,

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.470
and that makes you think,
OK, the column space

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.050
is all combinations of the
columns, it's that plane,

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.040
right?

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.270
I've got two vectors in
three-dimensional space,

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:19.130
their column space is a plane,
the column space of this matrix

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.700
is a plane, what's the
relation between the planes?

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.245
Between the two column spaces?

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.690
They're one and the same, right?

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.260
It's the same column space.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:39.080
All I'm taking is here this
B thing that I computed,

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:45.620
this B thing that I computed
is a combination of B and A,

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.130
and A was little A, so
I'm always working here

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.420
with this in the same space.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.950
I'm just like getting
ninety-degree angles in there.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:02.950
Where my original column space
had a perfectly good basis,

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.970
but it wasn't as
good as this basis,

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.110
because it wasn't orthonormal.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:15.060
Now this one is orthonormal,
and I have a basis then that --

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.550
so now projections, all the
calculations I would ever want

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:25.070
to do are -- are a cinch
with this orthonormal basis.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:28.210
One final point.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:29.980
One final point in this chapter.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.740
And it's -- just
like elimination.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.030
We learned how to
do elimination,

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.660
we know all the
steps, we can do it.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:50.220
But then I came back to it and
said look at it as a matrix

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:55.640
in matrix language and
elimination gave me --

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.980
what was elimination
in matrix language?

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.500
I'll just put it up there.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.740
A was LU.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.220
That was matrix,
that was elimination.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.680
Now, I want to do the
same for Graham-Schmidt.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.700
Everybody who works
in linear algebra

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.030
isn't going to write
out the columns

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.720
are orthogonal, or orthonormal.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.030
And isn't going to write
out these formulas.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:24.320
They're going to write out the
connection between the matrix A

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.820
and the matrix Q.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.730
And the two matrices have
the same column space,

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.220
but there's some -- some
matrix is taking the --

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:40.611
and I'm going to call it R, so
A equals QR is the magic formula

00:45:40.611 --> 00:45:41.110
here.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.765
It's the expression
of Graham-Schmidt.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:53.930
And I'll -- let me
just capture that.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:57.740
So that's the -- my final
step then is A equal QR.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.810
Maybe I can squeeze it in here.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.460
So A has columns,
let's say a1 and a2.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.650
Let me suppose n is
two, just two vectors.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:15.790
OK.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:21.800
So that's some
combination of q1 and q2.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:28.670
And times some matrix R.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.830
They have the same column space.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:35.920
This is just -- this matrix just
includes in it whatever these

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.930
numbers like three over three
and one over square root

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.860
of three and one over
square root of two,

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.900
probably that's what it's got.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.640
One over square root of three,
one over square root of two,

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.890
something there, but actually
it's got a zero there.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:47:00.760
So the main point about
this A equal QR is this R

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.770
turns out to be
upper triangular.

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.258
It turns out that this
zero is upper triangular.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.940
We could see why.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.140
Let me see, I can put in
general formulas for what these

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:20.699
This I think in here should
be the inner product of a1

00:47:20.699 --> 00:47:21.240
with q1. are.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.660
And this one should be the --

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.730
the inner product of a1 with q2.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.470
And that's what I
believe is zero.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:40.610
This will be something here,
and this will be something here

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:49.460
with inner -- a1 transpose q2,
sorry a2 transpose q1 and a2

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.560
transpose q2.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.635
But why is that guy zero?

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.400
Why is a1 q2 zero?

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.080
That's the key to this being
-- this R here being upper

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.610
triangular.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:10.600
You know why a1q2 is
zero, because a1 --

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.810
that was my --

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:15.680
this was really a and b here.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.200
This was really a and b.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.280
So this is a transpose q2.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.880
And the whole point of
Graham-Schmidt was that we

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:30.320
constructed these later q-s to
be perpendicular to the earlier

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.530
vectors, to the earlier --
all the earlier vectors.

00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.590
So that's why we get
a triangular matrix.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:45.252
The -- result is
extremely satisfactory.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:52.950
That if I have a matrix
with independent columns,

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:56.040
the Graham-Schmidt
produces a matrix

00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.280
with orthonormal columns, and
the connection between those

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.730
is a triangular matrix.

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.700
That last point, that the
connection is a triangular

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.010
matrix, please look
in the book, you

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:11.890
have to see that one more time.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:12.430
OK.

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:14.670
Thanks, that's great.
