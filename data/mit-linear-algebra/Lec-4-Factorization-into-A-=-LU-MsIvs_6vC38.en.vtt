00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.800
Okay, this is linear
algebra, lecture four.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.000
And, the first
thing I have to do

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is something that was on
the list for last time,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.169
but here it is now.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.369
What's the inverse of a product?

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.811
If I multiply two
matrices together

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:35.067
and I know their
inverses, how do I

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:39.559
get the inverse of A times B?

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.509
So I know what inverses
mean for a single matrix A

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.760
and for a matrix B.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.229
What matrix do I multiply by to
get the identity if I have A B?

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.100
Okay, that'll be
simple but so basic.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.892
Then I'm going to use that to --

00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:05.632
I will have a product of
matrices and the product

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.634
that we'll meet will be
these elimination matrices

00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:13.148
and the net result
of today's lectures

00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:16.565
is the big formula
for elimination,

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:20.632
so the net result
of today's lecture

00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:27.710
is this great way to look
at Gaussian elimination.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.400
We know that we get from
A to U by elimination.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.062
We know the steps -- but now
we get the right way to look

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.060
at it, A equals L U.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.800
So that's the high
point for today.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
Okay.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.320
Can I take the easy part,
the first step first?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.273
So, suppose A is invertible --
and of course it's going to be

00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:55.860
a big question, when is
the matrix invertible?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
But let's say A is invertible
and B is invertible,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.920
then what matrix gives
me the inverse of A B?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.470
So that's the direct question.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.869
What's the inverse of A B?

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.120
Do I multiply those
separate inverses?

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.655
Yes.

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:18.005
I multiply the two matrices
A inverse and B inverse,

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.230
but what order do I multiply?

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.290
In reverse order.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.020
And you see why.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.780
So the right thing to put
here is B inverse A inverse.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.820
That's the inverse I'm after.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.950
We can just check that A B times
that matrix gives the identity.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.950
Okay.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.542
So why -- once again, it's
this fact that I can move

00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:46.480
parentheses around.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.148
I can just erase them all and
do the multiplications any way

00:02:51.148 --> 00:02:52.329
I want to.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.209
So what's the right
multiplication to do first?

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.220
B times B inverse.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.400
This product here
I is the identity.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.080
Then A times the
identity is the identity

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.060
and then finally A times A
inverse gives the identity.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.680
So forgive the dumb
example in the book.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.189
Why do you, do the inverse
things in reverse order?

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.096
It's just like -- you
take off your shoes,

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:29.210
you take off your socks, then
the good way to invert that

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:35.060
process is socks back
on first, then shoes.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.660
Sorry, okay.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.320
I'm sorry that's on the tape.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.290
And, of course, on the other
side we should really just

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.258
check -- on the other side
I have B inverse, A inverse.

00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:51.759
That does multiply A
B, and this time it's

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.099
these guys that
give the identity,

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.040
squeeze down, they give the
identity, we're in shape.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.772
Okay.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.556
So there's the inverse.

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:02.056
Good.

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:05.260
While we're at it,
let me do a transpose,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.913
because the next lecture
has got a lot to --

00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:09.780
involves transposes.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.200
So how do I -- if I
transpose a matrix,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.300
I'm talking about square,
invertible matrices right now.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.500
If I transpose one,
what's its inverse?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.640
Well, the nice formula
is -- let's see.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.760
Let me start from A, A
inverse equal the identity.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.790
And let me transpose both sides.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.199
That will bring a
transpose into the picture.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.300
So if I transpose the identity
matrix, what do I have?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.600
The identity, right?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.192
If I exchange rows and
columns, the identity

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.990
is a symmetric matrix.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.940
It doesn't know the difference.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.673
If I transpose these guys,
that product, then again

00:05:02.673 --> 00:05:09.160
it turns out that I have
to reverse the order.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.814
I can transpose them
separately, but when I multiply,

00:05:12.814 --> 00:05:16.220
those transposes come
in the opposite order.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.580
So it's A inverse
transpose times A transpose

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.600
giving the identity.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.533
So that's -- this equation is
-- just comes directly from that

00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:27.032
one.

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:30.352
But this equation tells
me what I wanted to know,

00:05:30.352 --> 00:05:35.700
namely what is the inverse
of this guy A transpose?

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.540
What's the inverse of that
-- if I transpose a matrix,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.180
what'ss the inverse
of the result?

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.000
And this equation tells
me that here it is.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.659
This is the inverse
of A transpose.

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:02.220
Inverse of A transpose.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.100
Of A transpose.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.788
So I'll put a big
circle around that,

00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:13.140
because that's the
answer, that's the best

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.560
answer we could hope for.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.235
That if you want to know
the inverse of A transpose

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:26.640
and you know the inverse of A,
then you just transpose that.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.024
So in a -- to put
it another way,

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:33.408
transposing and inversing
you can do in either order

00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:35.259
for a single matrix.

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:35.759
Okay.

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.818
So these are like basic
facts that we can now use,

00:06:39.818 --> 00:06:44.920
all right -- so now
I put it to use.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.827
I put it to use by thinking
-- we're really completing,

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.980
the subject of elimination.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:01.610
Actually, -- the thing about
elimination is it's the right

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.930
way to understand what
the matrix has got.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.560
This A equal L U is the
most basic factorization

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.550
of a matrix.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.450
I always worry
that you will think

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.960
this course is all elimination.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.100
It's just row operations.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.420
And please don't.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:40.995
We'll be beyond that, but it's
the right algebra to do first.

00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:41.495
Okay.

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:44.870
So, now I'm coming
near the end of it,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.630
but I want to get
it in a decent form.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.270
So my decent form
is matrix form.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.593
I have a matrix A, let's
suppose it's a good matrix,

00:07:56.593 --> 00:07:59.911
I can do elimination,
no row exchanges --

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:03.220
So no row exchanges for now.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.640
Pivots all fine, nothing
zero in the pivot position.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.240
I get to the very
end, which is U.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.000
So I get from A to U.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.220
And I want to know
what's the connection?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.690
How is A related to U?

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.264
And this is going to
tell me that there's

00:08:20.264 --> 00:08:21.991
a matrix L that connects them.

00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:23.000
Okay.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.700
Can I do it for a
two by two first?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.495
Okay.

00:08:29.495 --> 00:08:32.679
Two by two, elimination.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:37.160
Okay, so I'll do it under here.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:37.660
Okay.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.978
So let my matrix A be --

00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:45.244
We'll keep it simple,
say two and an eight,

00:08:45.244 --> 00:08:49.018
so we know that the
first pivot is a two,

00:08:49.018 --> 00:08:51.690
and the multiplier's
going to be a four

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.733
and then let me put a
one here and what number

00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:58.613
do I not want to put there?

00:08:58.613 --> 00:08:59.112
Four.

00:08:59.112 --> 00:09:03.032
I don't want a four there,
because in that case,

00:09:03.032 --> 00:09:07.642
the second pivot would not --
we wouldn't have a second pivot.

00:09:07.642 --> 00:09:10.860
The matrix would be
singular, general screw up.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.360
Okay.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.090
So let me put some other
number here like seven.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.580
Okay.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.255
Okay.

00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:24.680
Now I want to operate on that
with my elementary matrix.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.340
So what's the elementary matrix?

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.824
Strictly speaking,
it's E21, because it's

00:09:30.824 --> 00:09:35.560
the guy that's going to produce
a zero in that position.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.655
And it's going to
produce U in one shot,

00:09:39.655 --> 00:09:43.310
because it's just a
two by two matrix.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.350
So two one and I'm going to take
four of those away from those,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.580
produce that zero and
leave a three there.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.080
And that's U.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.140
And what's the
matrix that did it?

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.900
Quick review, then.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.820
What's the elimination
elementary matrix E21 --

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.060
it's one zero, thanks.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.820
And -- negative four one, right.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:07.794
Good.

00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:08.294
Okay.

00:10:08.294 --> 00:10:12.020
So that -- you see the
difference between this

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.100
and what I'm shooting for.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.918
I'm shooting for A on one
side and the other matrices

00:10:18.918 --> 00:10:21.990
on the other side
of the equation.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.990
Okay.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.940
So I can do that right away.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.500
Now here's going to
be my A equals L U.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.310
And you won't have any
trouble telling me what --

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.160
so A is still two
one eight seven.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.082
L is what you're going to
tell me and U is still two one

00:10:44.082 --> 00:10:44.940
zero three.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.634
Okay.

00:10:45.634 --> 00:10:49.800
So what's L in this case?

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:57.220
Well, first -- so how is
L related to this E guy?

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.271
It's the inverse, because
I want to multiply through

00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.130
by the inverse of this, which
will put the identity here,

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.570
and the inverse will show
up there and I'll call it L.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.360
So what is the inverse of this?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.650
Remember those elimination
matrices are easy to invert.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:24.514
The inverse matrix for
this one is 1 0 4 1,

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:32.125
it has the plus sign because
it adds back what this removes.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:32.625
Okay.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:38.150
Do you want -- if we did the
numbers right, we must --

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.781
this should be correct.

00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:40.281
Okay.

00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:42.390
And of course it is.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.844
That says the first row's
right, four times the first row

00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:48.393
plus the second
row is eight seven.

00:11:48.393 --> 00:11:49.056
Good.

00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:49.720
Okay.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.920
That's simple, two by two.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.390
But it already shows the
form that we're headed for.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.190
It shows -- so what's
the L stand for?

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.640
Why the letter L?

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.790
If U stood for upper
triangular, then of course L

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.860
stands for lower triangular.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.840
And actually, it has ones on the
diagonal, where this thing has

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.920
the pivots on the diagonal.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.900
Oh, sometimes we may want
to separate out the pivots,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.537
so can I just mention that
sometimes we could also write

00:12:28.537 --> 00:12:32.881
this as -- we could have
this one zero four one --

00:12:32.881 --> 00:12:37.147
I'll just show you how I
would divide out this matrix

00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:39.160
of pivots -- two three.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.880
There's a diagonal matrix.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.980
And I just -- whatever
is left is here.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.630
Now what's left?

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:54.063
If I divide this first row
by two to pull out the two,

00:12:54.063 --> 00:12:57.140
then I have a one
and a one half.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.144
And if I divide the second row
by three to pull out the three,

00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:02.580
then I have a one.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:11.180
So if this is L U, this is
maybe called L D or pivot U.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.261
And now it's a
little more balanced,

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:21.100
because we have ones on
the diagonal here and here.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.920
And the diagonal
matrix in the middle.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.380
So both of those...

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:29.400
Matlab would produce either one.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.860
I'll basically stay with L U.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.451
Okay.

00:13:33.451 --> 00:13:39.960
Now I have to think about
bigger than two by two.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.780
But right now, this was
just like easy exercise.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.136
And, to tell the truth,
this one was a minus sign

00:13:48.136 --> 00:13:50.920
and this one was a plus sign.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.740
I mean, that's the
only difference.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.516
But, with three
by three, there's

00:13:59.516 --> 00:14:02.700
a more significant difference.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.740
Let me show you how that works.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:12.949
Let me move up to
a three by three,

00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:17.760
let's say some matrix A, okay?

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.130
Let's imagine it's
three by three.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.050
I won't write
numbers down for now.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.270
So what's the first
elimination step

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.970
that I do, the first
matrix I multiply it by,

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.375
what letter will I use for that?

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:35.415
It'll be E two one,
because it's --

00:14:35.415 --> 00:14:42.842
the first step will be to get a
zero in that two one position.

00:14:42.842 --> 00:14:43.520
right?

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.760
And then the next step will be
to get a zero in the three one

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.260
position.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.174
And the final step will be
to get a zero in the three

00:14:53.174 --> 00:14:57.089
two That's what elimination is,
and it produced U. position.

00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:06.820
And again, no row exchanges.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.494
I'm taking the nice case,
now, the typical case, too --

00:15:10.494 --> 00:15:13.522
when I don't have to
do any row exchange,

00:15:13.522 --> 00:15:15.920
all I do is these
elimination steps.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.900
Okay.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.376
Now, suppose I want that stuff
over on the right hand side,

00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:22.880
as I really do.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.470
That's, like, my point here.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.150
I can multiply these
together to get a matrix E,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.300
but I want it over on the right.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.670
I want its inverse over there.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:39.160
So what's the right
expression now?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:46.440
If I write A and
U, what goes there?

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.060
Okay.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.044
So I've got the
inverse of this, I've

00:15:49.044 --> 00:15:52.020
got three matrices in a row now.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.603
And it's their
inverses that are going

00:15:54.603 --> 00:15:58.300
to show up, because each
one is easy to invert.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.460
Question is, what
about the whole bunch?

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.780
How easy is it to
invert the whole bunch?

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.630
So, that's what
we know how to do.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.347
We know how to invert, we should
take the separate inverses,

00:16:11.347 --> 00:16:13.840
but they go in the
opposite order.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.800
So what goes here?

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.201
E three two inverse,
right, because I'll

00:16:18.201 --> 00:16:21.288
multiply from the left
by E three two inverse,

00:16:21.288 --> 00:16:26.600
then I'll pop it up next to U.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.880
And then will come
E three one inverse.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.888
And then this'll be
the only guy left

00:16:34.888 --> 00:16:40.910
standing and that's gone when
I do an E two one inverse.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.590
So there is L.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.300
That's L U.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.860
L is product of inverses.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:57.680
Now you still can ask why is
this guy preferring inverses?

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.570
And let me explain why.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:05.619
Let me explain why is this
product nicer than this one?

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:10.380
This product turns out to
be better than this one.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.060
Let me take a typical case here.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.250
Let me take a typical case.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.602
So let me --

00:17:18.602 --> 00:17:23.000
I have to do three by three
for you to see the improvement.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.400
Two by two, it was
just one E, no problem.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.960
But let me go up to this case.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:39.684
Suppose my matrices E21 --
suppose E21 has a minus two

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:41.460
in there.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.924
Suppose that -- and
now suppose -- oh,

00:17:45.924 --> 00:17:49.840
I'll even suppose
E31 is the identity.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.360
I'm going to make the point
with just a couple of these.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.900
Okay.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.589
Now this guy will have
-- do something --

00:17:59.589 --> 00:18:02.720
now let's suppose
minus five one.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.333
Okay.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:07.560
There's typical.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.563
That's a typical case in
which we didn't need an E31.

00:18:10.563 --> 00:18:14.660
Maybe we already had a zero
in that three one position.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.560
Okay.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:24.700
Let me see -- is that going to
be enough to, show my point?

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.500
Let me do that multiplication.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.350
So if I do that multiplication
it's like good practice

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.000
to multiply these matrices.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.115
Tell me what's above
the diagonal when

00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:39.900
I do this multiplication?

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.474
All zeroes.

00:18:40.474 --> 00:18:42.196
When I do this
multiplication, I'm

00:18:42.196 --> 00:18:48.280
going to get ones on the
diagonal and zeroes above.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.140
Because -- what does that say?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.549
That says that I'm subtracting
rows from lower rows.

00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:57.755
So nothing is
moving upwards as it

00:18:57.755 --> 00:19:00.471
did last time in Gauss Jordan.

00:19:00.471 --> 00:19:00.970
Okay.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:07.615
Now -- so really, what I have to
do is check this minus two one

00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:11.240
zero, now this is --
what's that number?

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.740
This is the number that
I'm really have in mind.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.900
That number is ten.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.620
And this one is
-- what goes here?

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:32.000
Row three against column two,
it looks like the minus five.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.100
What it's that ten.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.020
How did that ten get in there?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.040
I don't like that ten.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.429
I mean -- of course, I
don't want to erase it,

00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:42.220
because it's right.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.840
But I don't want it there.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.144
It's because -- the ten got in
there because I subtracted two

00:19:51.144 --> 00:19:56.467
of row one from row two, and
then I subtracted five of that

00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:58.760
new row two from row three.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.920
So doing it in that order, how
did row one effect row three?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.424
Well, it did, because two of
it got removed from row two

00:20:08.424 --> 00:20:11.590
and then five of those got
removed from row three.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:17.800
So altogether ten of row one
got thrown into row three.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.778
Now my point is in the
reverse direction --

00:20:21.778 --> 00:20:27.540
so now I can do it -- below
it I'll do the inverses.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.100
Okay.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.820
And, of course, opposite order.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.660
Reverse order.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.908
Reverse order.

00:20:35.908 --> 00:20:36.407
Okay.

00:20:36.407 --> 00:20:43.521
So now this is going to -- this
is the E that goes on the left

00:20:43.521 --> 00:20:44.020
side.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.790
Left of A.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.574
Now I'm going to do the
inverses in the opposite order,

00:20:51.574 --> 00:20:52.950
so what's the --

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.530
So the opposite order means
I put this inverse first.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:58.890
And what is its inverse?

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.290
What's the inverse of E21?

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.660
Same thing with a
plus sign, right?

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.692
For the individual matrices,
instead of taking away two

00:21:08.692 --> 00:21:16.620
I add back two of row one
to row two, so no problem.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.400
And now, in reverse order,
I want to invert that.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.840
Just right?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.540
I'm doing just this, this.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:32.470
So now the inverse is
again the same thing,

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.320
but add in the five.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.886
And now I'll do
that multiplication

00:21:40.886 --> 00:21:45.460
and I'll get a happy result.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.800
I hope.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.220
Did I do it right so far?

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:50.960
Yes, okay.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.168
Let me do the multiplication.

00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:53.350
I believe this comes out.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.660
So row one of the
answer is one zero zero.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.984
Oh, I know that all this
is going to be left, right?

00:21:59.984 --> 00:22:04.090
Then I have two one zero.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.560
So I get two one
zero there, right?

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.060
And what's the third row?

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:15.160
What's the third
row in this product?

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.640
Just read it out to
me, the third row?

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:25.269
0 5 1 Because one
way to say is this

00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:29.640
is saying take one of the
last row and there it is.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.590
And this is my matrix L.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:38.450
And it's the one that
goes on the left of U.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:45.190
It goes into --
what do I mean here?

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.990
Maybe rather than saying
left of A, left of U,

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.040
let me right down
again what I mean.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:58.600
E A is U, whereas A is L U.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.560
Okay.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.300
Let me make the
point now in words.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.090
The order that the matrices
come for L is the right order.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:16.442
The two and the
five don't sort of

00:23:16.442 --> 00:23:20.456
interfere to produce
this ten one.

00:23:20.456 --> 00:23:23.844
In the right order,
the multipliers

00:23:23.844 --> 00:23:26.919
just sit in the matrix L.

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:32.485
That's the point -- that
if I want to know L,

00:23:32.485 --> 00:23:35.530
I have no work to do.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.420
I just keep a record of
what those multipliers were,

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.370
and that gives me L.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:52.610
So I'll draw the
-- let me say it.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.320
So this is the A=L U.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:07.370
So if no row exchanges, the
multipliers that those numbers

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:14.977
that we multiplied
rows by and subtracted,

00:24:14.977 --> 00:24:21.746
when we did an
elimination step --

00:24:21.746 --> 00:24:27.550
the multipliers go
directly into L.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.950
Okay.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:42.770
So L is -- this is the way,
to look at elimination.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.046
You go through the
elimination steps,

00:24:46.046 --> 00:24:50.414
and actually if you
do it right, you

00:24:50.414 --> 00:24:57.120
can throw away A
as you create L U.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.817
If you think about it,
those steps of elimination,

00:25:02.817 --> 00:25:08.520
as when you've finished
with row two of A,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:14.305
you've created a new row two
of U, which you have to save,

00:25:14.305 --> 00:25:18.256
and you've created the
multipliers that you used --

00:25:18.256 --> 00:25:22.980
which you have to save,
and then you can forget A.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.919
So because it's all
there in L and U.

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:35.699
So that's -- this moment
is maybe the new insight

00:25:35.699 --> 00:25:41.995
in elimination that
comes from matrix --

00:25:41.995 --> 00:25:44.070
doing it in matrix form.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:48.420
So it was -- the
product of Es is --

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.350
we can't see what
that product of Es is.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:56.350
The matrix E is not a
particularly attractive one.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:00.202
What's great is when we put
them on the other side --

00:26:00.202 --> 00:26:02.130
their inverses in
the opposite order,

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.700
there the L comes
out just right.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.210
Okay.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:14.160
Now -- oh gosh, so today's a
sort of, like, practical day.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:20.670
Can we think together how
expensive is elimination?

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.570
How many operations do we do?

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:30.540
So this is now a kind of new
topic which I didn't list as --

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.516
on the program,
but here it came.

00:26:33.516 --> 00:26:34.980
Here it comes.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:55.780
How many operations
on an n by n matrix A.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.020
I mean, it's a very
practical question.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:04.653
Can we solve systems of
order a thousand, in a second

00:27:04.653 --> 00:27:08.280
or a minute or a week?

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:15.014
Can we solve systems of order a
million in a second or an hour

00:27:15.014 --> 00:27:16.460
or a week?

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:21.510
I mean, what's the
-- if it's n by n,

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.059
we often want to take n bigger.

00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:28.700
I mean, we've put
in more information.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.880
We make the whole thing is more
accurate for the bigger matrix.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.024
But it's more expensive,
too, and the question

00:27:37.024 --> 00:27:39.000
is how much more expensive?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.679
If I have matrices
of order a hundred.

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:43.150
Let's say a hundred
by a hundred.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:47.660
Let me take n to be a hundred.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.840
Say n equal a hundred.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.860
How many steps are we doing?

00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:00.130
How many operations are we
actually doing that we --

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.328
And let's suppose there
aren't any zeroes,

00:28:03.328 --> 00:28:06.676
because of course if a matrix
has got a lot of zeroes

00:28:06.676 --> 00:28:09.570
in good places, we don't
have to do those operations,

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:13.500
and, it'll be much faster.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:21.940
But -- so just think for a
moment about the first step.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:27.180
So here's our matrix A,
hundred by a hundred.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.508
And the first step
will be -- that column,

00:28:32.508 --> 00:28:35.568
is got zeroes down here.

00:28:35.568 --> 00:28:41.080
So it's down to 99 by 99, right?

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.920
That's really like the
first stage of elimination,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.070
to get from this hundred
by hundred non zero

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.810
matrix to this stage where the
first pivot is sitting up here

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:59.440
and the first row's okay
the first column is okay.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.120
So, eventually -- how
many steps did that take?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.409
You see, I'm trying
to get an idea.

00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:11.860
Is the answer proportional to n?

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.567
Is the total number of steps in
elimination, the total number,

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:19.510
is it proportional to n -- in
which case if I double n from

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:24.140
a hundred to two hundred --
does it take me twice as long?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.350
Does it square, so it would
take me four times as long?

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.600
Does it cube so it would
take me eight times as long?

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.242
Or is it n factorial, so it
would take me a hundred times

00:29:36.242 --> 00:29:37.120
as long?

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.580
I think, you know, from a
practical point of view,

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.280
we have to have some
idea of the cost, here.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.816
So these are the
questions that I'm --

00:29:46.816 --> 00:29:48.720
let me ask those
questions again.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.620
Is it proportional -- does
it go like n, like n squared,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.420
like n cubed -- or
some higher power of n?

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.403
Like n factorial where every
step up multiplies by a hundred

00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:06.743
and then by a hundred and one
and then by a hundred and two

00:30:06.743 --> 00:30:07.980
-- which is it?

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.796
Okay, so that's
the only way I know

00:30:10.796 --> 00:30:14.320
to answer that is to think
through what we actually

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.100
had to do.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.100
Okay.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.643
So what was the cost here?

00:30:22.643 --> 00:30:23.309
Well, let's see.

00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:25.700
What do I mean by an operation?

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:32.549
I guess I mean, well
an addition or -- yeah.

00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:33.549
No big deal.

00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:36.807
I guess I mean an
addition or a subtraction

00:30:36.807 --> 00:30:38.980
or a multiplication
or a division.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.540
Okay.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:48.980
And actually, what operation
I doing all the time?

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:56.040
When I multiply row one
by multiplier L and I

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.870
subtract from row six.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.060
What's happening
there individually?

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.460
What's going on?

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.896
If I multiply --

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:08.490
I do a multiplication by
L and then a subtraction.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.715
So I guess operation --

00:31:10.715 --> 00:31:15.610
Can I count that for the
moment as, like, one operation?

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.520
Or you may want to
count them separately.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:26.740
The typical operation is
multiply plus a subtract.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.721
So if I count those together, my
answer's going to come out half

00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:33.226
as many as if --

00:31:33.226 --> 00:31:35.333
I mean, if I count
them separately,

00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:37.593
I'd have a certain
number of multiplies,

00:31:37.593 --> 00:31:39.000
certain number of subtracts.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.478
That's really want to do.

00:31:40.478 --> 00:31:40.977
Okay.

00:31:40.977 --> 00:31:43.360
How many have I got here?

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.500
So, I think -- let's see.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:56.293
It's about -- well,
how many, roughly?

00:31:56.293 --> 00:31:59.360
How many operations to
get from here to here?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.576
Well, maybe one
way to look at it

00:32:02.576 --> 00:32:05.800
is all these numbers
had to get changed.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.086
The first row
didn't get changed,

00:32:08.086 --> 00:32:11.900
but all the other rows
got changed at this step.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:18.884
So this step -- well,
I guess maybe --

00:32:18.884 --> 00:32:25.880
shall I say it cost
about a hundred squared.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.174
I mean, if I had
changed the first row,

00:32:29.174 --> 00:32:32.874
then it would have been exactly
hundred squared, because --

00:32:32.874 --> 00:32:35.549
because that's how
many numbers are here.

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:40.169
A hundred squared numbers is
the total count of the entry,

00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:44.300
and all but this insignificant
first row got changed.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.660
So I would say about
a hundred squared.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.620
Okay.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.150
Now, what about the next step?

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.960
So now the first row is fine.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.020
The second row is fine.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.580
And I'm changing these
zeroes are all fine,

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.700
so what's up with
the second step?

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.620
And then you're with me.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.390
Roughly, what's the cost?

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:14.086
If this first step
cost a hundred squared,

00:33:14.086 --> 00:33:16.858
about, operations
then this one, which

00:33:16.858 --> 00:33:27.490
is really working on this guy to
produce this, costs about what?

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.250
How many operations to fix?

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.370
About ninety nine squared, or
ninety nine times ninety eight.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.610
But less, right?

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.590
Less, because our
problem's getting smaller.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.280
About ninety-nine squared.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.996
And then I go down and down
and the next one will be ninety

00:33:44.996 --> 00:33:47.498
eight squared, the next ninety
seven squared and finally

00:33:47.498 --> 00:33:50.620
I'm down around
one squared or --

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.750
where it's just like
the little numbers.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.890
The big numbers are here.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:02.182
So the number of operations
is about n squared plus that

00:34:02.182 --> 00:34:06.190
was n, right? n was a hundred?

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:10.975
n squared for the first step,
then n minus one squared,

00:34:10.975 --> 00:34:17.025
then n minus two squared,
finally down to three squared

00:34:17.025 --> 00:34:23.040
and two squared and
even one squared.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.929
No way I should have written
that -- squeezed that in.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:34.355
Let me try it so the count
is n squared plus n minus one

00:34:34.355 --> 00:34:41.980
squared plus -- all the
way down to one squared.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.899
That's a pretty decent count.

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:50.835
Admittedly, we didn't catch
every single tiny operation,

00:34:50.835 --> 00:34:57.040
but we got the right
leading term here.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.180
And what do those add up to?

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.500
Okay, so now we're coming
to the punch of this,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.030
question, this operation count.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:16.751
So the operations on the
left side, on the matrix A

00:35:16.751 --> 00:35:19.820
to finally get to U.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:26.211
And anybody -- so which of
these quantities is the right

00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:28.540
ballpark for that count?

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.692
If I add a hundred squared to
ninety nine squared to ninety

00:35:32.692 --> 00:35:35.248
eight squared --
ninety seven squared,

00:35:35.248 --> 00:35:41.088
all the way down to two
squared then one squared,

00:35:41.088 --> 00:35:44.020
what have I got, about?

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:48.100
It's just one of these --
let's identify it first.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.020
Is it n?

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.080
Certainly not.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.700
Is it n factorial?

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.460
No.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.430
If it was n factorial, we
would -- with determinants,

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.020
it is n factorial.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:09.148
I'll put in a bad mark against
determinants, because that --

00:36:09.148 --> 00:36:12.400
okay, so what is it?

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:18.580
It's n -- well,
this is the answer.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.240
It's this order -- n cubed.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.380
It's like I have n terms, right?

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.690
I've got n terms in this sum.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.140
And the biggest
one is n squared.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.710
So the worst it could
be would be n cubed,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:41.315
but it's not as bad as
-- it's n cubed times --

00:36:41.315 --> 00:36:45.270
it's about one third of n cubed.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:53.690
That's the magic
operation count.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:58.874
Somehow that one third
takes account of the fact

00:36:58.874 --> 00:37:02.339
that the numbers
are getting smaller.

00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:04.049
If they weren't
getting smaller, we

00:37:04.049 --> 00:37:06.044
would have n terms
times n squared,

00:37:06.044 --> 00:37:08.240
but it would be exactly n cubed.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.304
But our numbers are getting
smaller -- actually,

00:37:09.304 --> 00:37:11.137
row two and row one
moves down to row three.

00:37:11.137 --> 00:37:15.986
do you remember where does
one third come in this --

00:37:15.986 --> 00:37:19.400
I'll even allow a
mention of calculus.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.016
So calculus can be
mentioned, integration

00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:28.360
can be mentioned now in the next
minute and not again for weeks.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.440
It's not that I don't like
18.01, but18.06 is better.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.125
Okay.

00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:41.660
So, -- so what's -- what's the
calculus formula that looks

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.350
like?

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:48.518
It looks like -- if we were
in calculus instead of summing

00:37:48.518 --> 00:37:50.589
stuff, we would integrate.

00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:54.405
So I would integrate
x squared and I

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:57.331
would get one third x cubed.

00:37:57.331 --> 00:38:03.172
So if that was like an
integral from one to n,

00:38:03.172 --> 00:38:09.859
of x squared b x, if the answer
would be one third n cubed --

00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:13.329
and it's correct for the sum
also, because that's, like,

00:38:13.329 --> 00:38:14.900
the whole point of calculus.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.660
The whole point of
calculus is -- oh,

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.640
I don't want to tell
you the whole --

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.280
I mean, you know the
whole point of calculus.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:27.990
Calculus is like sums
except it's continuous.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.782
Okay.

00:38:28.782 --> 00:38:31.950
And algebra is discrete.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:32.950
Okay.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.010
So the answer is
one third n cubed.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:40.080
Now I'll just -- let me say one
more thing about operations.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.920
What about the right-hand side?

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.250
This was what it cost
on the left side.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:50.380
This is on A.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.180
Because this is A that
we're working with.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:57.830
But what's the cost on
the extra column vector b

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.660
that we're hanging around here?

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.685
So b costs a lot
less, obviously,

00:39:04.685 --> 00:39:07.570
because it's just one column.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.469
We carry it through
elimination and then

00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:14.260
actually we do
back substitution.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.160
Let me just tell you
the answer there.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.420
It's n squared.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.220
So the cost for every right
hand side is n squared.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.724
So let me --

00:39:25.724 --> 00:39:34.488
I'll just fit that in here --
for the cost of b turns out

00:39:34.488 --> 00:39:37.000
to be n squared.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.290
So you see if we have,
as we often have,

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:49.931
a a matrix A and several
right hand sides, then we

00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:54.494
pay the price on A, the
higher price on A to get it

00:39:54.494 --> 00:39:58.404
split up into L and U
to do elimination on A,

00:39:58.404 --> 00:40:02.810
but then we can process every
right hand side at low cost.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:03.860
Okay.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:11.790
So the -- We really have
discussed the most fundamental

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:16.560
algorithm for a
system of equations.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.700
Okay.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:29.500
So, I'm ready to
allow row exchanges.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.824
I'm ready to allow -- now
what happens to this whole --

00:40:32.824 --> 00:40:38.400
today's lecture if
there are row exchanges?

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.240
When would there
be row exchanges?

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.356
There are row -- we need to do
row exchanges if a zero shows

00:40:46.356 --> 00:40:47.840
up in the pivot position.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.820
So moving then into the final
section of this chapter,

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.820
which is about
transposes -- well,

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:02.722
we've already seen
some transposes, and --

00:41:02.722 --> 00:41:13.700
the title of this section is,
"Transposes and Permutations."

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.321
Okay.

00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:21.160
So can I say, now, where
does a permutation come in?

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.300
Let me talk a little
about permutations.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:34.620
So that'll be up
here, permutations.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:41.420
So these are the matrices that
I need to do row exchanges.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.560
And I may have to do
two row exchanges.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.008
Can you invent a
matrix where I would

00:41:48.008 --> 00:41:54.180
have to do two row exchanges
and then would come out fine?

00:41:54.180 --> 00:42:01.460
Yeah let's just, for the heck
of it -- so I'll put it here.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.120
Let me do three by threes.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.298
Actually, why don't
I just plain list

00:42:07.298 --> 00:42:10.480
all the three by three
permutation matrices.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.010
There're a nice
little group of them.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:20.880
What are all the matrices
that exchange no rows at all?

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.070
Well, I'll include the identity.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:29.710
So that's a permutation matrix
that doesn't do anything.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.494
Now what's the permutation
matrix that exchanges --

00:42:34.494 --> 00:42:36.288
what is P12?

00:42:36.288 --> 00:42:41.760
The permutation matrix that
exchanges rows one and two

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.608
would be --

00:42:43.608 --> 00:42:46.072
0 1 0 --

00:42:46.072 --> 00:42:48.540
1 0 0, right.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:53.360
I just exchanged those rows of
the identity and I've got it.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:53.904
Okay.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:56.080
Actually, I'll -- yes.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:01.715
Let me clutter this up.

00:43:01.715 --> 00:43:02.215
Okay.

00:43:02.215 --> 00:43:06.340
Give me a complete list of
all the row exchange matrices.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.540
So what are they?

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.990
They're all the ways I can
take the identity matrix

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.780
and rearrange its rows.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.620
How many will there be?

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:21.820
How many three by three
permutation matrices?

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.100
Shall we keep going
and get the answer?

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.500
So tell me some more.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.306
STUDENT: Zero one
STRANG: Zero What

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:31.000
one are you going to do now?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.842
STUDENT: I'm going to switch the
STRANG: Switch rows one and --

00:43:36.842 --> 00:43:39.510
One and three, okay.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.520
One and three,
leaving two alone.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.460
Okay.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.573
Now what else?

00:43:45.573 --> 00:43:49.283
Switch -- what would
be the next easy one --

00:43:49.283 --> 00:43:51.540
is switch two and three, good.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:55.720
So I'll leave one zero zero
alone and I'll switch --

00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:00.218
I'll move number three
up and number two down.

00:44:00.218 --> 00:44:00.717
Okay.

00:44:00.717 --> 00:44:04.209
Those are the ones that
just exchange single --

00:44:04.209 --> 00:44:05.798
a pair of rows.

00:44:05.798 --> 00:44:10.814
This guy, this guy and this
guy exchanges a pair of rows,

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:13.340
but now there are
more possibilities.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.080
What's left?

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.640
So tell -- there is
another one here.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.260
What's that?

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:26.440
It's going to move -- it's
going to change all rows, right?

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.160
Where shall we put them?

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.780
So -- give me a first row.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.800
STUDENT: Zero one zero?

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.740
STRANG: Zero one zero.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:38.000
Okay, now a second row -- say
zero zero one and the third guy

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.960
One zero zero.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.420
So that is like a cycle.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:49.412
That puts row two moves up to
row one, row three moves up

00:44:49.412 --> 00:44:53.420
to row two and row one
moves down to row three.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:45:00.180
And there's one more,
which is -- let's see.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.280
What's left?

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.032
I'm lost.

00:45:04.032 --> 00:45:05.240
STUDENT: Is it zero zero one?

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.560
STRANG: Is it zero zero one?

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.060
Okay.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.120
STUDENT: One zero zero.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.260
STRANG: One zero zero, okay.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:16.460
Zero one zero, okay.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.980
Great.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.930
Six.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.780
Six of them.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:28.674
Six P. And they're sort
of nice, because what

00:45:28.674 --> 00:45:35.580
happens if I write, multiply
two of them together?

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.836
If I multiply two of
these matrices together,

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:42.100
what can you tell
me about the answer?

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.360
It's on the list.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.790
If I do some row
exchanges and then I

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.950
do some more row exchanges,
then all together

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.520
I've done row exchanges.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.520
So if I multiply --
but, I don't know.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.680
And if I invert, then I'm
just doing row exchanges

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.349
to get back again.

00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:01.869
So the inverses are all there.

00:46:01.869 --> 00:46:06.717
It's a little family
of matrices that --

00:46:06.717 --> 00:46:11.565
they've got their
own -- if I multiply,

00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:14.400
I'm still inside this group.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.785
If I invert I'm inside
this group -- actually,

00:46:16.785 --> 00:46:18.920
group is the right
name for this subject.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:24.320
It's a group of six matrices,
and what about the inverses?

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:28.160
What's the inverse of
this guy, for example?

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:32.956
What's the inverse -- if I
exchange rows one and two,

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.700
what's the inverse matrix?

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.760
Just tell me fast.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:43.858
The inverse of that matrix is --
if I exchange rows one and two,

00:46:43.858 --> 00:46:49.878
then what I should do to get
back to where I started is

00:46:49.878 --> 00:46:51.150
the same thing.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.572
So this thing is
its own inverse.

00:46:54.572 --> 00:46:55.905
That's probably its own inverse.

00:46:55.905 --> 00:46:57.819
This is probably
not -- actually,

00:46:57.819 --> 00:47:00.380
I think these are
inverses of each other.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:06.320
Oh, yeah, actually -- the
inverse is the transpose.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.542
There's a curious fact
about permutations matrices,

00:47:11.542 --> 00:47:16.020
that the inverses
are the transposes.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.771
And final moment -- how
many are there if I --

00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:21.820
how many four by
four permutations?

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:29.880
So let me take four by
four -- how many Ps?

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.720
Well, okay.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.940
Make a good guess.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.479
Twenty four, right.

00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:38.020
Twenty four Ps.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:38.740
Okay.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:43.060
So, we've got these
permutation matrices,

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:48.820
and in the next
lecture, we'll use them.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.660
So the next lecture,
finishes Chapter 2

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.160
and moves to Chapter 3.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.710
Thank you.
