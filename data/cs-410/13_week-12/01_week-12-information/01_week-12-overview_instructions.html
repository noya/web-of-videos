  Week 12 Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  During this week's lessons, you will learn about techniques for joint mining of text and non-text data, including contextual text mining techniques for analyzing topics in text in association with various context information such as time, location, authors, and sources of data. You will also see a summary of the Text Mining content.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain why it is necessary and useful to perform joint analysis and mining for text and non-text data.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain the general idea of Contextual Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (CPLSA) and the main difference between CPLSA and PLSA.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Give multiple application examples of CPLSA for contextual text mining.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain the general idea of using the social network of authors as context to analyze topics in text data and its potential benefit from an application perspective.
   </p>
  </li>

 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the week.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>

    Why is text-based prediction interesting from an application perspective? Why are humans playing an important role in text-based prediction? What is the “data mining loop”?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why is it necessary and useful to jointly mine and analyze text and non-text data? How can non-text data potentially help in analyzing text data? How can text data potentially help in mining non-text data?
   </p>
  </li>

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
