  The Technology Review assignment is designed to provide students with
 an opportunity to go beyond the materials covered in the course 
lectures to explore an interesting course-related cutting-edge 
technology topic not covered in any lecture or a new idea about future 
technology.  In this assignment, a student is required to write a short 
blog article on a chosen topic by the student. The topic of a technology
 review can be flexible as long as the blog article is related to the 
general topic of "text data retrieval and analysis" and has clear 
novelty, i.e., the content of the blog article is new and not covered in
 any existing articles.  The goal is to allow the readers of your blog 
article to learn something new and useful that they can't learn from 
elsewhere. The following are some possibilities, but you may consider 
other kinds of topics as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  1) A tutorial on a useful software
 toolkit or a comparison of multiple toolkits for processing text data 
or building text data applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  2) A review of emerging new applications of text retrieval or analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  3) A review of new techniques for text retrieval or analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  4) A visionary essay about a new idea of promising future technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  5)
 An analysis of limitations of existing technologies (e.g., analysis of a
 difficult query that does not work well on Google and a potential 
explanation of the speculated reasons why it didn't work well or a 
proposal of an idea to help improve the query).
 </p>
 <p>
  Working in a team 
is allowed for finishing the Technology Review; indeed, if you choose a 
topic related to your course project for the Tech Review, you may also 
consider working together with the teammates of your project team for 
finishing the Tech Review. When working in a team, each team member must
 make substantial contributions to a review (i.e., must have written at 
least 1000 words). This means that a review produced by a team of 3 team
 members is expected to be much longer than a review produced by a 
single-student team. A review written by a team with more than one 
member must include a brief description of contribution of each 
individual member.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Technology Review will be graded
 based on completion. Each team is required to submit a complete 
Technology Review at Week 14. This deadline is set to an earlier time 
than that of course project code submission so as to give the students 
an opportunity to read some relevant reviews (especially those on 
toolkits) before finishing their projects if they want to. Details about
 how to submit the review will be posted later.
