00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.600
Our final discussion in
basic text processing

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.310
is segmenting out sentences
from running text.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.330
So how are we going to
segment out sentences?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.295
Things that end in exclamation points or

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:14.740
question marks,
that's really great, because

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.750
those are relatively unambiguous cues that
we've gotten to the end of a sentence.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.478
Periods, unfortunately,
are quite ambiguous.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:27.552
If you think about it, a period can be
a sentence boundary, but periods are also

00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:33.235
used for abbreviations like Inc., or Dr.,
they're used for numbers like 0.02 or

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:37.518
4.3, so we can't assume that
a period is the end of a sentence.

00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:42.280
So what we need to do to solve the period
problem, is build ourselves a classifier.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.240
We're going to build a binary classifier,
that looks at a period, and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.920
simply makes a binary yes/no decision.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.540
Am I at the end of a sentence?

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.128
Am I not at the end of a sentence?

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:55.329
And to make this classifier,
we could use hand-written rules,

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.280
we could use regular expressions, or we
could build machine-learning classifiers.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.200
The simplest kind of classifier for this
is a decision tree, so here's a simple

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.920
decision tree for deciding whether
a word is an end of sentence or not.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.860
So, a decision tree is a simple if then
procedure that asks a question, and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.230
branches based on
the answer to the question.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.040
So we say, am I in a piece of text that
has a lot of blank lines after me?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.850
Well if so,
then I'm probably an end of sentence.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.730
What if there's no blank lines after me?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.420
Well, is my final punctuation
a question mark or

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.250
an exclamation point, if so, well then
I'm still probably end of sentence.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.020
Well if not that,
is my final punctuation a period?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.614
If it's not,
well I'm not an end of sentence, but

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:46.548
if I am a period, well then, it depends.

00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:52.043
If I'm on some long list of abbreviations,
like the word etc., then I'm probably not

00:01:52.043 --> 00:01:57.488
an end of a sentence, I'm just a period
marking an abbreviation, like Dr., or etc.

00:01:57.488 --> 00:02:00.708
But if I'm not an abbreviation,
then I'm end of sentence.

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:01.990
So here's a decision tree.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.830
And you can imagine, arbitrarily,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.910
sophisticated decision tree
features that we could use.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.350
So, one thing we can use is the case,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.300
or it's called the word shape,
of the word with the period.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.260
Am I an uppercase word?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.710
Am I a lower case word?

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.150
Am I all caps or uppercase,
meaning the first letter's uppercase,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.590
lower meaning it's lowercase,
cap meaning it's all caps.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.600
Am I a number?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.370
Any of these kind of word shape
features can give us information.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.600
An all caps word is very
likely to be an abbreviation.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.330
We can look at the word with the period,
and we can look at the word

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.040
after the period, if the next word
starts with a capital letter, then I'm

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.040
likely to be the beginning, a period that
ends a sentence, because the next word

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.930
starts with a capital letter, and
we can look at lots of numeric features.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.230
So we can look at,
am I a long word or a short word?

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.900
So, abbreviations tend to be relatively
short acronyms, tend to be very short.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.545
And I can use very sophisticated features,
so I can say,

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:12.220
let's look at the word I'm looking
at right now, take this word, and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.830
ask in a corpus that I've already know
where the sentence boundaries are,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.790
how often is this word occur with
a period at the end of a sentence.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.628
Is this the kind of word
that ends a sentence?

00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:27.310
Is this a kind of word, for example,
the tends to start a sentence,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.198
this is the word, the word,
this phrase, for example, the word,

00:03:32.198 --> 00:03:36.610
the, after a period, very likely to
be a capital, The, after a period,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.150
very likely to start a sentence,
the space in between.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.108
So, this will have a high probability
of being a start of a sentence, and we

00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:50.217
can use these kind of features, depending
on condition on each of the words,

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:55.118
again, to help us in deciding what is or
isn't an end of sentence period.

00:03:57.398 --> 00:04:01.835
Now a decision tree is just
an if-then-else statement, so

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:06.130
that's just the definition
of what a decision tree is.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.040
The interesting research
is choosing the features.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.850
So we've seen a number features you
might pick for this particular task.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.100
In general, the structure of a decision
tree is often too hard to build by hand.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.212
In general, hand-building of
decision trees is possible only for

00:04:22.212 --> 00:04:24.130
very simple features or simple domains.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.800
You might build a simple
decision tree with six or

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.080
seven rules like this for
some simple tasks.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.550
But, it's very hard to do for
numeric features because

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.710
you have to pick the threshold for
each of the numeric features.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.040
I'm picking a probability
as one of my features.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.170
I've gotta have a question in the decision
tree, is this probability greater than

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.538
some threshold theta or not, and
I've got to set all those thetas.

00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:52.381
And so, generally, we use machine learning
that learns the structure of the tree and

00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:56.898
learns things like the threshold for
each of the questions that we're asking.

00:05:00.358 --> 00:05:04.411
Nonetheless, the questions in a decision
tree, we can think of them as the kind of

00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.703
features that could be exploited
by any other kind of classifier,

00:05:07.703 --> 00:05:10.818
whether it's logistic regression,
or SVM, or neural nets,

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:13.318
some of the classifiers
we'll talk about later.

00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:18.008
So, this intuition that we can build
a classifier, we can derive features that

00:05:18.008 --> 00:05:22.558
are good predictors of whether a period
is acting as an end of sentence or not.

00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:26.960
And then we can put these features
into any kind of classifier, holds for

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.718
whatever classifier
we're going to be using.
