00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.370
In this segment, I will give a brief
introduction to the task of the part of

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.790
speech taking, and then we will come back
and see how discriminative sequence models

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.134
can be used as a technique for
the part of speech taking.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.505
There are many linguistic traditions
in different parts of the globe

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:21.385
that in the West, the idea of parts of
speech have started with Aristotle in

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:24.355
the 4th century before the common era.

00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:29.385
And he suggested the idea that there were
parts of speech which are otherwise known

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:37.020
as lexical categories, word classes,
tags or POS is a common abbreviation.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.390
But what we think of today is the parts
of speech are normally attributed to

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.860
Dionysius Thrax of Alexandria.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.580
We propose that there
are 8 parts of speech and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.470
that's the number that's
still with us today.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.210
It's the number of parts of speech
people get taught, in school sometime.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.120
They're actually, if you look into
the details a little, the 8 parts

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.590
of speech that Dionysius Thrax proposed
aren't the same that are with us today.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.740
So the normal list that people are taught
in schools in English now, noun,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.960
verb, adjective, adverb, preposition,
conjunction, pronoun, interjection,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.110
but for Thrax there was actually some
little differences in the list, and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.170
of course, he was working with
ancient Greek and not with English.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.360
So the beginning of the list starts
out the same but note that he doesn't

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.340
recognized adjective as a part of speech,
and Greek and Latin adjectives and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.460
nouns behave very similarly, but he does
recognize participle as a part of speech.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.753
And then, the other difference is that
a separate part of speech is given for

00:01:40.753 --> 00:01:41.430
articles.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.530
Words like the and a, where as in
the modern list you get a class for

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.770
interjections.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.950
The status of the articles has
always been a bit controversial.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.660
In our current standard set
of eight parts of speech,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.240
articles are seen as a case of adjectives,
but actually as you start looking at

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.400
the grammar of languages like English
that the articles have a very

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.360
special behavior which is quite
different from regular adjectives.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.220
For example, adjectives,
you can get multiple of large

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.330
green letter couch, whereas you can't
do things like, the artist book

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.890
Except as a kind of speech hesitation as
to which article you should be using.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.008
When we do part of speech taking
in computational linguistics,

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.605
we normally work with rather more
than eight parts of speech because

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:32.886
there are a lot of distinctions
which can be useful to make that

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:35.178
multiplies the number of parts of speech.

00:02:35.178 --> 00:02:39.355
And so, I start to indicate the kinds of
parts of speech you get in this slide and

00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:42.598
you can see that there are various
hierarchical groupings.

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:46.525
So inside nouns we can divide into
proper nouns and common nouns and

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:49.399
we might also want to
divide between singular and

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.918
plural which can happen with
both proper and common nouns.

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:58.536
Verbs, very much divide into main verbs,
see, registered,

00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:03.838
versus various exhilarant,
modal verbs like can and had.

00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:05.540
There are adjectives and adverbs.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.500
Note that adjectives, or at least
the short adjectives in English have

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.800
several forms, the positive,
comparative and superlative.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.790
And we might want to distinguish
those forms, as well.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.840
Neither of the lists on the last slide
had numbers, but they seem a fairly

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.570
obvious and practically useful
part of speech to recognize.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.950
And then, similarly here,
among the closed classes,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.330
I'll say bit more about closed
classes on the next slide.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.450
We don't have a category
that's called articles,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.670
we have a category called determinants.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.412
So the modern linguistic tradition
is to group the articles up and

00:03:39.412 --> 00:03:44.020
the together with certain other
demonstratives that behave similarly.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.259
Words like some, this.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.820
And then, we have some other categories.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.790
Prepositions are familiar but we're
distinguishing off the class of particles.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.110
So the particles here are words that
are normally the same as prepositions

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.040
that take part in English
phrasal verb constructions.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.449
Things like made up, meaning to invent.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.580
The top level distinction on the last
slide was between open classes and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.220
closed classes.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.190
It's very clear that not all
parts of speech are the same.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.290
Some of them, like determiners and

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.140
pronouns, are occupied by
only a small set of words.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.290
So in English, for pronouns,
there's, he, she, it, him, who and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.640
the first and
second person pronouns I, you, we.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.890
The person plural they, them but it just
a very small set of words and they aren't

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.160
new new pronouns being invented and so
things like that we call closed class.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.360
Because in general,
closed classes don't get new members,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.340
though sometimes occasionally they
do over long term language change,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.430
so sometimes people have suggested
that we should be inventing some new

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.390
gender neutral pronouns in English
though nothing's really taking off.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.310
But in contrast the open classes,
nouns, verbs, adjectives,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.440
adverbs, these are classes which
have a vast number of members.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.620
And beyond that it's very easy for
them to gain new members.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.390
So that when we have a new protocol in
computer science we create a new noun for

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.090
it, like SSH, and then very quickly we
decide it's useful to use that as a verb

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.300
as well, and then we say, I SSHd into
my server to fix the configuration.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.160
The task of part of speech
taking is to say for

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.480
each word what its part of speech is
in the context of some running text.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.240
The reason why that's not trivial is
because lots of words have more than

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.000
one part of speech so,
for example, for the word,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.580
back, it can be an adjective, but
it's modifying a noun, like the back door.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.350
Or it can be a noun when it's referring
to the body part, on my back.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.550
It can be an adverb in a phrase like,
win the voters back.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.550
And it can also then be a verb.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.790
In another political example,
promised to back the bill.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.670
And so, what we're wanting to do is when
we see an instance of the word back,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.620
assign it to one of these parts of speech.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.160
So in the task of part of speech tagging,
we start with some text.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.100
Plays well with others.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.669
And then, for each word, we consider
what are its possible parts of speech so

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.009
that plays can be a plural noun or
verb, well,

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.370
it can be an interjection,
an adjective, a noun, or an adverb.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.980
With can be is just a preposition here.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.970
And others is a plural noun.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.590
And so, for the words that are ambiguous,
we then going to choose for

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.600
them what their correct part
of speech is in context.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.110
And so here, plays is a verb, and
well as in adverb modifying place.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.560
And we get this ambiguating
this part of speech.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.620
So what we're finding here at the end
when we've got here, these choices

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.020
here which we then determining,
these are part of speech tags.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.470
And depending on the part of
speech tag set that commonly,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.750
a natural language processing
application somewhere between 12 and

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.340
100 part of speech tags
that are differentiated.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.240
And so, you can see that this set of
part of speech tags is differentiating

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.810
things like is it a plural noun or
a singular noun.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.440
Here's a singular noun.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.080
Or if it is a verb,
what form of the verb it is.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.680
So this is the third person
singular plays, as opposed to play.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.140
So the particular part of speech tag set
that we've seen here is the Penn Treebank

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.330
part of speech tags, which are the most
commonly used part of speech tags for

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.800
English, especially in the United States.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.390
I'm embarrassed to say that I've
been in this business long enough

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:56.010
that I can actually tell you off my hand
what all the Penn part of speech takes.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:01.690
There's a set of 45 of them which cover
word classes like this and punctuation.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.620
So what could this part of speech taking

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.870
as well as letting you answer
your highschool English problems?

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.090
It has a variety of other uses.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.975
It has some particular uses by just
part of speech as sufficient, so

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:22.135
that if you're doing text to speech, and
you see an instance of the word L-E-A-D,

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:25.585
you want to know whether to
pronounce it as lead or lead.

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:28.675
And the answer to that is, well,
what's its part of speech?

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.295
If it's a verb, it's lead.

00:08:30.295 --> 00:08:31.675
If it's a noun, it's lead.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.930
Having parts of speech lets you easily
do some sofa linguistic analysis.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:44.280
So for lots of applications it's useful to
pick out what we call base noun phrases.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.652
So there, noun or

00:08:45.652 --> 00:08:51.698
noun compound possibly modified in front
by a determiner in symmetric terms.

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:56.781
So the nearest school or
an old green couch are base noun

00:08:56.781 --> 00:09:05.330
phrases whereas big complex noun phrases
with relative clauses after them aren't.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.990
If we have parts of speech, we can easily
write regular expressions that pick out

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:13.950
things like base noun phrases or verbs
followed by a particle for phrasal verbs.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.180
And that can be used for a lot of
applications where you want to do shallow

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.640
processing, but
nevertheless want to be able to put

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.730
to give to the user multiwords keywords,
or something like that.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.750
Part of speech taking is commonly use
as input to, or to speed up a parser,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.810
so quite a few parsers work on
already part of speech texts,

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.330
and even ones that can do their
own part of speech taking,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.180
can often be split up by first doing
the process of part of speech tagging.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.050
And finally, a lot of models we build for

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:52.040
probability estimation are very sparse
if they try to work at the word level.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.245
And we discussed various ways of
backing off where you might back

00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:57.740
off from a tri-gram or bi-gram earlier.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.100
But another common way of backing
off is to back off from a word that

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.580
you don't know much about to
its part of speech category,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.140
you can predict by still
knowing it's an adjective.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.050
Part of speech tagging performance
is normally measured as accuracy.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.840
What percent of tags do you get right?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.274
And the answer for that,

00:10:17.274 --> 00:10:22.310
that for the best current taggers
they get about 97% of words right.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.320
That sounds really good, it is important
to realize that part of speech

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.660
taking is in some sense an easy task or at
least a task where you get high numbers.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:38.290
So there's a baseline approach to
part of speech taking where you tag

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.990
every word with this most common tag if
you know about in your training data and

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.070
if you don't know about in your training
data you take it as a noun, and it turns

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.144
out to that fairly simple baseline method
already gets your performance of 90%.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.820
And so, it turns out that you get this
high baseline for a couple of reasons.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.400
One reason is that many
words are unambiguous,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.750
that if you see famous,
it's always an adjective.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.740
And also the way part of speech
tagging is normally measured,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.930
that you get points for every token.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.840
So not only do you get points for

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.360
every instance of unambiguous articles
which are very common like that in art.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.090
You even get points for getting the part
of speech tags and punctuation right.

00:11:23.012 --> 00:11:26.890
But that doesn't mean that all
parts of speech decisions are easy.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:31.628
Some part of speech decisions are quite
difficult even for human beings.

00:11:31.628 --> 00:11:35.900
And so,
here some examples of the word around, so

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.478
here we have around acting
as a pathecal go around to,

00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:45.160
here we have around against
straight after verb that is

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.046
time is its prepositional
phrase around the corner and so

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:53.148
around it's being a preposition.

00:11:53.148 --> 00:11:56.182
And here, again, in this third example,

00:11:56.182 --> 00:12:01.325
around is again following straight
after a verb, but actually this time

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:07.248
it's a modifier of this noun phrase
of around 250, short for around $250.

00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:10.810
And so, around is then an adverb.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.940
It's modifying a number which
is kind of like an adjective.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.750
It turns out that in English
corpus around 11% of

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:25.670
the word types are ambiguous
with regard to part of speech.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.700
That doesn't sound like very many.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.780
But most of them tend to be common words.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.271
Such as the word that.

00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:37.720
So that can be a word that
introduces a subordinate clause.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.200
And in the Penn Treebank those words
are tagged as I-N preposition,

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.300
which might surprise you.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.680
There's some linguistic
argument about that.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:53.360
It can be a determiner that play or
it can be an adverb so modifying here far.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.140
That far is an adverb.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.041
And so, it turns out that although only
11% of the word types are ambiguous in

00:13:01.041 --> 00:13:05.210
the part of speech, about 40% of
the word tokens are ambiguous,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.697
so there actually are a lot of decisions
for part of speech taker to make.

00:13:09.697 --> 00:13:13.892
I hope that's given you a bit of
background information on part of speech

00:13:13.892 --> 00:13:18.520
taking so you can make sense of the task
in terms of our methods for approaching it
