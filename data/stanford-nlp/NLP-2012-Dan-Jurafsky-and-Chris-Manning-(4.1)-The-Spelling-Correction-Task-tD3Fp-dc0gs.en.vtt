00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.810
Today we're going to talk
about spelling correction.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.930
Lots of applications make
use of spelling correction.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.510
For example, word processing,
almost any modern word processor

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.480
will take a misspelled word like component
with an a and give you suggestions

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.800
like component with an e, and
automatically replace it for you.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.510
Modern search engines will not only flag
an error, so language spelled without a u

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.600
here, but give you the results as if
you had spelled the word correctly.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.598
And modern phones additionally will
automatically find misspelled words here,

00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:43.860
I typed layr and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.540
it replaced it automatically or
suggests a replacement with late.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.660
We can distinguish a number of
separate tasks in spelling correction.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.200
One is the detection of
the error itself and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.560
then the correction of
the error once you've found it.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.020
We can think about different
kinds of correction.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.810
We might automatically correct
an error if we're positive that we

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.340
know the right answer for the error.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.540
So hte is a very common misspelling for

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.400
the, so many word processors
automatically correct hte.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.280
We might suggest a single correction if
there's only one very likely correction.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.250
Or we might suggest a whole
list of corrections and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.760
let the user pick from among them.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.805
We distinguish two different
classes of spelling errors.

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:32.960
Non-word errors are errors in which what
the user types is not a word of English.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.260
So G-R-A-F-F-E, a misspelling, let's say,
for giraffe, is not a word of English.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.740
By contrast,
real word errors are errors in which

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.300
the resulting misspelling is
actually a word of English and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.648
that makes them somewhat harder to detect.

00:01:51.648 --> 00:01:55.650
And we can break up real word errors into

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.190
ones produced by really
typographical processes.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.100
The user meant to type three and
typed there, let's say.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.050
Or cognitive errors where the user
meant to type a word like piece and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.240
instead typed a homophone of the word or
t-o-o instead of t-w-o.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.291
And in both cases,
what's produced in a word of English,

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:22.660
but by modelling the differences
between these kind of errors,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.810
in my pump of better
ways of fixing them both.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.780
How common are spelling errors?

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.490
Depends a lot on the task.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.380
So in web queries,
spelling errors are extremely common.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.990
So, practically one in four.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.910
Words in a web query are more
likely to be misspelled.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.200
In word processing tasks on phones it's
much harder to get an accurate number.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.230
So there's been a number of studies, and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.950
most of these studies
are done by retyping.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.770
You give the user a passage to type, and
then you measure how well they type it.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.083
And that's of course not quite the same
as users naturally writing messages or

00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:58.614
typing.

00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:02.577
Nonetheless, if you ask users to re-type,
and

00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:09.063
you don't let them use the backspace key,
they make about 13% are in error.

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:14.470
So indicating that a lot of words they
correct themselves with the backspace.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.180
If you let them correct, now we're
turning to experiment on a PDA style,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.790
a phone sized organizer, they'll correct
about 7% of the work themselves.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.870
They'll still leave about 2%
uncorrected on organizer.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.540
And similar numbers on people doing
retyping, on a regular keyboard.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.580
So a number of about 2%
where people typing and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.410
probably a much higher number for
web quarries, and probably a much higher

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.290
number for people texting are the kinds
of spelling error rates that we see.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.760
How do we detect non-word spelling errors?

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.420
The traditional way is just
to use a large dictionary.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.030
Any word not in
the dictionary is an error.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.550
The larger the dictionary,
it turns out, the better this works.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.560
For correcting these non-word spelling
errors we generate a set of candidates,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.150
that's real words that
are similar to the error.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.590
And then we pick whichever one is best,
and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.390
we'll talk about the noisy channel
probability model of how to do that.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.390
And it's also related to another method
called the shortest weighted edit

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.510
distance method.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.110
So we find words that are not in the
dictionary, for each one we generate a set

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.400
of candidates, and those are going to
be real words that are similar.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.120
We'll talk about what
similar means to that error,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.490
and then we'll pick the best one.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.910
For real world spelling errors,
the algorithm is quite similar.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.440
Again, for each word, we generate
a candidate set, but now we do this for

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.660
every word in the sentence, not just
the words that are not in some dictionary.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.000
So with real world spelling error
correction, we don't use a dictionary,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.230
because of course the errors are in
the dictionary, so that wouldn't help.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.070
So for every word we generate a candidate
set so we might find candidate words with

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.540
similar pronunciations, we might find
candidate words with similar spelling and

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.110
depending on the algorithm exactly and
it's very important that we're going on

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.930
include the word itself in
the candidate set because the every

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.140
word might be a misspelling of some other
real word or it might be the correct word.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.820
In fact, most words are probably correct.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.620
So for
each candidate set of each possible error,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.530
we're going to include the word itself.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.080
And most of the time, in fact,
we're going to pick that.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.600
And again, how we pick the words,
we might use the noisy channel model.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.980
We might use a classifier.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.610
We'll talk about that.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.330
So we'll discuss the different
methods of detecting these errors and

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.240
correcting them in the next section.
