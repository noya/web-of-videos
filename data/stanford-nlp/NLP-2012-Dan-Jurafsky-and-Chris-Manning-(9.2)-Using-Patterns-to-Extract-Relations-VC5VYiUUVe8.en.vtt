00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.560
Perhaps, the simplest way of
doing relation extraction

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.750
is using hand-built patterns.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.760
Let's look at the intuition.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.720
Here's a sentence.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.840
Agar is a substance prepared
from a mixture of red algae,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.910
such as Gelidium, for
laboratory or industrial use.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.676
Perhaps you, like me, I didn't know
what the word Gelidium meant, but

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:23.550
I can learn what it means
from this sentence.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.550
And the way we know is
that we see this phrase,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.890
red algae, such as Gelidium, so that tells
us that Gelidium is a kind of red algae.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.780
And this intuition from an early
paper by Marti Hearst suggested that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.584
there's in fact a lot of patterns
that can be used to suggest that two

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:45.061
entities are in this IS-A or
hyponym relation.

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:50.361
So, for example, knowing if I
saw red algae such as Gelidium,

00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:54.570
that tells us that Gelidium
is a kind of red algae.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.160
So, x is a kind of y.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.435
I might see other patterns like
Gelidium or other red algae, or

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:07.267
Gelidium and other red algae, or
red algae including Gelidium.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:11.780
In each case, I have A textual
pattern holding between two entities.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.010
That's a strong cue that what I
have here is a particular relation

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.040
between the two entities.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.600
And Hearst showed that these kind of
patterns were able to learn the IS-A

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.190
relation between new terms,
such as Bambara ndang and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.800
bow lute, or learning about author names,
or learning country names and so

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.910
on, that could be added to a database.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.420
Now, the same kind of intuition about
using handwritten rules to learn relations

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.674
can be used for the richer relations
that we've been looking at,

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:46.145
richer than just IS-A or hyponym.

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:50.724
And the intuition for learning these
more richer rules is that these

00:01:50.724 --> 00:01:54.188
relations often hold
between specific entities.

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:58.775
So, the located-in relation often holds
between an organization and a location,

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:03.235
where the founded relation holds
between a person and an organization.

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:07.750
So, in addition to just coming up with
clever string patterns that might indicate

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.880
a relation, we can also use facts about
the actual entities that are involved,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.620
and that will help us learn which
kind of relations we might have.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.300
In other words, we're going to
start with the entity tags and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.251
that's going to help us
do relation extraction.

00:02:21.251 --> 00:02:23.473
Now, many of these aren't quite enough and
to see this,

00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:25.140
let's look at a couple of examples.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.603
Imagine I have an entity drug and
an entity disease.

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:30.720
What kind of relations can
hold between those entities?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.220
Well, a lot.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.460
A drug could cure a disease.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.840
It could prevent a disease.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.110
It could even cause a disease.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.090
And that's true for any kinds of entities
between a person and an organization.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.400
The person could be the founder
of the organization.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.600
They could be an investor
in the organization,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.631
a member of the organization,
an employee of the organization.

00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:52.285
They could be the president
of the organization, so

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:55.072
any kind of relation may
hold between these entities.

00:02:55.072 --> 00:03:00.057
Although, there are constraints, so the
person can't cure, can't be the cure, or

00:03:00.057 --> 00:03:02.740
the disease cause, or
other kinds of things.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.180
There are constraints from
the named entities, but

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.860
lots of other relations
meet those constraints.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.060
And so, we're going to combine these
two intuitions using a pattern and

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.770
using the name entities.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.960
So, we can combine these two intuitions,
use of a named entity and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.790
use of specific patterns,
to extract richer relations.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.930
Consider the question, who holds
what office in what organization?

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.400
So, we'd like to extract from
a sentence like George Marshall,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.420
Secretary of State of the United States
that a person, George Marshall

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.390
played the role or had the office of
Secretary of State in an organization,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.519
the United States government.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.880
And so, we have an entity person, an
entity position, an entity organization.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.000
And here's a pattern, person, comma,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.430
position of organization that might
extract from a sentence like this,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.870
the position of relation between
a person and an organization.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.810
And we might need to have another pattern
for sentences of a different form.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.380
So, here we have person, Truman
appointed Marshall Secretary of State.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.222
So, we might have person appointed or some
other word like named or chose, and so

00:04:11.222 --> 00:04:16.110
on, person, position, and we might have
an optional preposition in between.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.900
So, Truman appointed Marshall as Secretary
of State would be an option there, or

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.270
just Truman appointed
Marshall Secretary of State.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.270
So, again, a combination of our

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.860
patterns with maybe a list of possible
words we might get from a thesaurus or

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.985
some kind of thing, and
the named entities of the entities.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.220
Or finally, another pattern, George
Marshall was named US Secretary of State,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.920
so again person, maybe a form of the verb
to be, and optionally, followed by,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.230
again, one of these named or appointed
words, and maybe an optional preposition,

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.720
and then, the organization and
the position.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.904
So, by combining the named entity types
with the words or perhaps parts of speech

00:04:56.904 --> 00:05:01.649
in between, we can create patterns
that extract particular relations.

00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:08.017
Now, an advantage of the pattern
extraction algorithm for

00:05:08.017 --> 00:05:12.430
doing a relation extraction is that these
human patterns tend to be high-precision.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.090
If you look at a particular domain and
you write rules, and the rules are usually

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.090
pretty high-precision, and they can be
tailored to these very specific domains.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.860
If you have a particular relation
extraction task when you write rules,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.470
they can get this high-precision.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.574
The minuses are that human
patterns tend to be low-recall.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.550
Often, you don't think of a particular
way somebody might have thought to word

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.280
a certain sentence in free text
that expresses a relation.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.090
And it's also a lot of work to do this,
especially if you have a lot of relations.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.780
You're going to have to come up with very
specific patterns for each relation and

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.060
for each domain in this relation.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.780
And it'd be nice to also get
a higher accuracy than you can get

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.488
from these relations.

00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:52.790
So, while hand-built patterns
are a useful method for

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.190
relation extraction,
we're going to look at other methods like,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.110
supervised and
unsupervised methods as well.

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:01.840
So, handwritten rules with patterns and
other kinds of words,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.030
and parts of speech in between
are a good way to extract relations.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.790
They have some problems of accuracy and
of generalizing to new domains.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.578
And so, we're going to also introduce
other methods of doing relation

00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:16.750
extraction like supervised and
unsupervised learning.
