00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.240
Let's now turn to the use of
summarization in question answering.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.110
The goal of summarization is to produce an
abridged version of a text that contains

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.910
information that's important to or
relevant for a user, particular user need.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.680
And so that might mean abstracting
any kind of document or

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.040
article, summarizing email threads or
meetings, simplifying text.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.780
We'll talk about compressing sentences.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.720
And we can talk about
summarization in two ways.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.650
Single document summarization,
given a single document,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.530
we're going to produce an abstract or
an outline.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.820
Perhaps a headline,
a very short summary of a document.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.390
In multiple document summarization,
we're given a group of documents,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.620
presumably related documents, and our job
is to produce the gist of these documents.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.040
So, if we have some news
stories on the same event,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.530
we might summarize the event by picking
the information from different documents.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.930
That can be true also for

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.520
any kind of set of web pages that
are focused on some topic or question.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.830
Now, we distinguish between
generic summarization and

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.970
query focused summarization.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.130
Generic summarization is
what I talked about so far.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.920
We have some document or
some set of documents and

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.050
our job is just to build a summary.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.450
Query focused summarization is
summarizing a document with respect to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.740
the information need that the user
expresses by their query.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.050
So, you can think of query-focused
summarization just another kind of complex

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.010
question and answering, where answering
a question by summarizing a document

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.280
that has the information in it to
construct the answer that the user needs.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.920
Now, we've all seen
query-focused summaries,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.280
because that's what search engines use to
show you the information about a page.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.920
So for example Google will
give you 156 characters,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.570
about 26 words for each page,
as a summary of the page.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.380
So if I'd asked a question to Google,
what is Die Brucke?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.395
And I get say these three URLs back we

00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:58.475
have the title of the URL, and then some
text and that text, that snippet is some

00:01:58.475 --> 00:02:02.755
kind of summary of the page that helps
the user understand what's in the page.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:06.345
So we can think of summarization
in general of single documents

00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:08.405
as generating things like snippets.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:12.505
And we're going to talk about the more
general task of specifically just snippets

00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:17.730
for web search but you can think of these
snippets as a characteristic example.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.170
Now where a snippet is the answer to a
question, taking information from a single

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.900
document, we often want the answer
from multiple documents.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.430
So creating answers to complex
questions that involve summarizing for

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.380
multiple documents,
we're going to create a cohesive answer

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.730
that combines information
from each of these documents.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.370
So that's multiple document
question answering,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.030
now we can think of two ways
of doing summarization.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.660
In extractive summarization we created
a summary by taking particular words or

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.500
phrases that are in the documents and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.338
building a summary just out
of this words or phrases.

00:02:50.338 --> 00:02:52.830
And a snippet from a search
engine like Google

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.360
as an extractive summary in this way.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.650
I contrast an abstractive summary as
one which we create our own words,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.680
different words than are in the text,
to summarize the content of the text.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.180
And we're going to be talking completely
about extractive summarization today.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.560
Abstractive summarization is an important
research goal, but very difficult.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.940
And one thing to think about whenever
we're talking about summarizing from

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.410
a document whether it's a webpage or

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.280
anything else is what our baselines are
for summarization and good writers often

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.870
put their ideas right at the beginning
at the title or at the first sentence.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.630
So a simple baseline whenever we're
measuring any kind of summarization

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.830
algorithm, is just taking
the first sentence.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.735
So, for example, in this Google query,
what is the Die Brucka,

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:44.564
if we took the output from this first hit,
and we look at the sentence, Die Brucka

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:49.062
was a group of German expressionist
artists formed in Dresden, and so on.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:56.081
Let's look at this page,
where the snippet comes from and

00:03:56.081 --> 00:04:01.095
we can see that this
snippet is really just

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:06.265
the first 156 characters of this page.

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:10.285
So sometimes the best snippet
is really just the beginning.

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:13.095
And so we're going to use that not only
as a baseline, but later we'll see that

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:16.555
that's a feature we could use in different
kinds of summarization algorithms.

00:04:18.915 --> 00:04:23.305
We've introduced the task of natural
language generations, producing abstracts,

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:26.310
summaries, or
even headlines from a document.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.720
And we've talked about
query focus summarization,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.530
where we use summarization to
answer a particular question.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.590
We built a summary of a document that is

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.800
specifically designed to answer
a question posed by the user.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.900
And we've talked about single and multiple
document summarization, and now we'll see

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.350
the details of how to do each of
these tasks in the further lectures.
