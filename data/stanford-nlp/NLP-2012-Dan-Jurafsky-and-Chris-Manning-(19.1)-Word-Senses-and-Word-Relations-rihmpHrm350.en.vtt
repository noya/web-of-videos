00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.130
Welcome back.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.720
In this lecture we begin to
talk about word meaning and

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.620
how to decide if two words
have the same meaning.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.613
Let's look at some fundamentals.

00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:14.231
You may remember from an earlier lecture
we talked about the difference between

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:15.320
lemmas and wordforms.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.480
A lemma is a citation form that has
the same stem, the same part of speech,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.850
some rough semantics, where a wordform is
the inflected word as it appears in text.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.470
So for example,
the wordform banks has a lemma bank.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.232
The wordform sung has a lemma sing.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.270
And this is of course true for
all languages.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.844
The Spanish word duermes has the lemma
dormir, the you sleep and to sleep.

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:48.280
Now each lemma can have multiple meanings.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.689
So for example, the lemma bank,
we can have a sentence

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:59.620
like a bank can hold the investments or
the east bank.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.405
So here we have some kind of
financial institution and

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:07.700
here some kind of sloping land, let's say.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.850
So we call this difference, sense.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.340
We say a sense, or

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.745
a word sense, is a discrete representation
of the aspects of a word meaning.

00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:21.140
And so we want to say that lemma bank here
has two senses or at least two senses,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.127
sense 1 this financial institution,
and sense 2 this sloping land.

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:34.582
The word homonymy means the situation
in which words share a form but

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:36.947
have distinct unrelated meanings.

00:01:36.947 --> 00:01:39.030
We call the two words homonyms.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880
Homonyms, homonymy.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.620
So bank 1, financial institution, and
bank 2, sloping land, are homonyms.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.420
Similarly, bat 1, club for
hitting a ball, and bat 2,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.180
a nocturnal flying mammal, are homonyms.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.140
Now homonyms come in two forms.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.570
They can be homographs.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.630
That's words that are spelled the same,
whether or

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.470
not they're pronounced the same or
differently.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.650
So bank and bat are homographs.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.700
Or they can be homophones.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.520
So write, W-R-I-T-E, and right,
R-I-G-H-T, sound the same but

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.950
they're spelled differently.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.780
And sometimes homonyms are both
homographs and homophones, so bank and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.200
bat are both homographs and homophones.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.470
Sometimes they're only pronounced
the same but spelled differently.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.656
Sometimes they're only spelled
the same but pronounced differently.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.704
Homonymy causes a number of problems for
applications and

00:02:35.704 --> 00:02:37.420
natural language processing.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.710
So if you're doing information
retrieval and you ask about bat care,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.170
we don't know if you have a pet flying
mammal or if you're a baseball fan.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.408
And machine translation the similar
problem, if you say the English word bat,

00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:53.378
in Spanish you might
mean the flying mammal or

00:02:53.378 --> 00:02:55.900
again you might mean a baseball club.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.717
Text-to-speech, the stringed
instrument called a bass is

00:03:00.717 --> 00:03:05.570
pronounced differently than
the fish called the bass.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.130
So if we're going to read the word out
loud in text-to-speech we have to know

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.080
which word we're talking about.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.190
So consider these two
senses of the word bank.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.050
The bank was constructed in
1875 out of local red brick.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.210
And I withdrew my money from the bank.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.290
Are those the same sense?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.620
You might call sense 2 a financial
institution, so I withdrew my money from

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.950
this financial institution, and
sense 1 something about the building.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.200
So here when I see this
bank was constructed,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.770
I would mean the building
associated with the bank.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.170
So these two senses,
the financial institution and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.570
the building belonging to the financial
institutions, are related.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.390
So when the two senses of
a homonymous word are related,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.040
we call the word polysemous.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.710
So a polysemous word has
multiple related meanings.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.754
And most non-rare words have multiple
meanings, and so polysemy is quite common.

00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:05.123
When the meanings between
related words are systematic,

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:09.100
we call this systematic polysemy or
sometimes metonymy.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.680
So lots of polysemy is systematic.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.790
So for example, words like school,
university, hospital,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.040
all of these have the same
polysemy we saw for bank.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.410
They can mean the institution or
they can mean the building.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.940
So we say there's a systematic
relationship between buildings and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.920
organizations.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.410
There's other kinds of
systematic polysemy.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.900
So we might refer to an author,
Jane Austen wrote Emma, or

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.400
her works, I love Jane Austen meaning
I love the books that she writes,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.710
or Jane Austen is stored
on that shelf over there.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.700
Trees, we might talk about
the blossoms of plums, or the fruit,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.550
the plum I ate yesterday.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.750
And again,
a systematic polysemy between authors and

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.420
works of the author or
trees and their fruit.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.872
So lots of kinds of systematic
polysemy like this.

00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:05.770
How do we know when a word
has more than one sense?

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.957
One test we often use is the zeugma or
zeugma test.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.470
Consider these two senses
of the word serve.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.480
Which flights serve breakfast?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.820
And does Lufthansa serve Philadelphia?

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.590
Where here we mean give
a meal to a passenger, and

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.120
here we mean an airline
flies to a particular city.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.100
And the zeugma test says
let's form a sentence

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.350
using both senses of the word serve and
see how bad it sounds.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.429
So does Lufthansa serve breakfast and
San Jose?

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:35.270
Well, that sounds funny.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.350
And so
since this conjunction sounds weird,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.460
we say these are two
different senses of serve.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.800
We say two words are synonyms if they have
the same meaning in some or all context.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.160
So a nut can be called hazelnut by
some people and filbert by others, and

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.490
it means the same thing.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.710
Or a couch and a sofa, or the words
big and large, or automobile and car.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.089
So we say two lexemes are synonyms
if they can be substituted for

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.028
each other in all situations.

00:06:05.028 --> 00:06:09.069
And if that's the case, we say they
have the same propositional meaning.

00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:17.850
Now as it happens, there are very few or
perhaps no examples of perfect synonymy.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.782
Even if many aspects of meaning of two
words are identical, they still may not

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:28.370
preserve their acceptability depending on
politeness or slang or register or genres.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.555
So while water and

00:06:30.555 --> 00:06:35.030
H2O technically mean the same thing,
in practice we're not going to use H2O

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.630
to describe our beautiful day in
the mountains looking at a running stream.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.550
And even big and large,
which seem like they might be synonyms,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.230
have different meanings
in different situations.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.420
Let's look at that.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.630
So we might say, how big is that plane?

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.893
Or would I be flying on a large or
a small plane?

00:06:57.893 --> 00:07:00.945
And it sounds like the senses of big and
large are the same there.

00:07:00.945 --> 00:07:01.854
They seem like synonyms.

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:08.135
They both refer to a measure of size and
were large on some scale of size.

00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:10.215
But consider these sentences.

00:07:10.215 --> 00:07:12.945
Miss Nelson became a kind
of big sister to Benjamin.

00:07:12.945 --> 00:07:15.375
Miss Nelson became a kind of
large sister to Benjamin.

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.520
But here big and
large mean very different things.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.070
Big sister means older sister here, and

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.300
large sister simply
can't have that meaning.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.470
It means a physically larger sister,
which is a funny kind of meaning.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:33.020
And so we want to say that big here
has a sense that large simply lacks.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.710
There's a sense of big that means older,
or grown up, and

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.510
large just lacks this sense.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.750
So sometimes even if two words
seem to have very similar meaning,

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.210
some of the senses may be
different between the two words.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.055
And that tells us that synonymy is really
a relation between senses rather than

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.770
a relationship between words.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.278
So we say that one of the senses of big,
the one meaning physically large, and one

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:03.469
of the senses of large, meaning physically
large, see, it's hard to define, isn't it?

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:06.753
Both of those senses, those senses
are in a synonymy relationship but

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:07.821
not the entire words.

00:08:09.806 --> 00:08:13.050
Another important relationship
in the word senses is antonymy.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.850
So antonyms are senses that are opposites
with respect to one feature of meaning and

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.280
otherwise very similar.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:26.620
So we have dark and light,
Short and long, fast and slow.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.820
All these are words which
had very similar meanings.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.340
Short and long both mean I'm a property
of length, and short just means I'm at

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.850
this end of the scale and long means
I'm at the other end of the scale.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:44.520
So more formally, we say antonyms
define a binary opposition or

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.530
they can be at opposite ends of the scale,
so two kinds of antonymy.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:54.720
So in long and short and fast and
slow we have this binary opposition.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.440
Or they can be reversives.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.030
So in a verb like to rise or
to fall or the words up and

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.980
down, they're not at different ends of
the scale, they're different directions.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.820
So we say the reverse of directions.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.350
So two kinds of antonymy.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.480
Again, relationships between senses,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.530
specific kind of
relationship between senses.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.420
And perhaps the most important
relationship between senses that we'll see

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.960
is that of hyponymy and hypernymy.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.030
So we say that one sense
is a hyponym of another

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.050
if the first sense is more specific or
denotes a subclass of the other.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:33.480
So we say that car is a hyponym of
vehicle, mango is a hyponym of fruit,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.330
so another word for
hyponym might be subclass or subordinate.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.660
And conversely, hypernym or

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.910
superordinate, I try to remember
this by saying that hyper is super.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.620
Here we have vehicle is a hypernym of
car meaning it's a supertype of car.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.220
Car is a subtype of vehicle.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.330
Vehicle is superordinate of car.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.790
Fruit is a hypernym of mango.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.535
And so I've given you some examples here
with the superordinate like vehicle and

00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:01.880
the subordinate like car.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.790
So hypernyms or hyponyms,
hypernyms, hyponyms,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.130
or superordinate,
subordinate will be synonyms here.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.770
Now more formally, we say that the class
denoted by the superordinate, or

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.380
hypernym, extensionally includes
the class denoted by the hyponym.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.190
We can define hyponymy also by entailment.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:30.946
We say a sense A is a hyponym of sense
B if being an A entails being a B.

00:10:30.946 --> 00:10:34.838
And hyponymy is usually transitive,
so if A is a hyponym of B and

00:10:34.838 --> 00:10:39.180
B is a hyponym of C,
that entails that A is a hyponym of C.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.920
And another common name for this hyponymy
hierarchy is the IS-A hierarchy.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.470
Intuitively, we say A IS-A B, or
A ISA B sometimes without the dash.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.441
Or we also sometimes
say that B subsumes A.

00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:54.680
And we'll see all of these terms,
ISA, hyponymy,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.442
subsumption hierarchy,
as we proceed through the course.

00:11:00.984 --> 00:11:05.605
We often make a distinction between
hyponyms and instances, and WordNet,

00:11:05.605 --> 00:11:10.490
the thesaurus we'll talk about in a bit,
has both classes and instances.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:15.250
An instance is an individual,
a proper noun that is a unique entity.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.370
And so we say San Francisco,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.280
that instance,
is an instance of the class city.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.990
So instance is a relationship
between an individual and a class.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.410
City is a class, and so we can say
city is a hyponym of municipality or

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.966
location or other kinds of classes.

00:11:30.966 --> 00:11:35.760
So hyponymy or subsumption is
a relationship between a class and

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.900
another class.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.068
Instance is a relationship between
an individual and a class.

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:47.768
These are some of the fundamental
definitions we'll need in talking about

00:11:47.768 --> 00:11:48.970
extracting word meaning.
