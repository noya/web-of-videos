00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.800
A thesaurus is one of the most important
repositories for word meaning and

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.920
this lecture will talk about WordNet,
one of the most important thesauri.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.740
Thesauri or ontologies are used for
all sorts of applications.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.107
Information extraction or
retrieval, question answering,

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:21.543
lots of bioinformatic applications,
machine translations.

00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:22.890
They play a role in all sorts of places.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.171
One of the most commonly used ones,

00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:28.983
WordNet is a hierarchically
organized lexical database.

00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:33.110
It's an online thesaurus, but
also it has some aspects of a dictionary.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.150
WordNet itself is in English,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.230
but there's lots of other languages that
are either available or under development.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.300
And WordNet itself,
we have about over 100,000 nouns and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.153
over 10,000 verbs, and
also adjectives and adverbs.

00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:52.470
And for each of those we're going to have
definitions and ontological relations.

00:00:56.393 --> 00:01:01.050
So, for example, take the word bass,
or bass, in WordNet.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.380
We have nouns and we also have verbs.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.713
So here's a list of nouns,
each of the senses, and adjectives.

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:14.387
So we have one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:19.943
seven, eight senses of bass or
bass in WordNet.

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:25.290
Sea bass or freshwater bass,
bass voice or basso, and so on.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.650
And in WordNet a sense is defined by
what's called a synset or synonym set,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.170
that is the set of near-synonyms similar
words that instantiate a sense or

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.540
a concept and also we have a gloss.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.940
So for example, take chump as a noun,
we have the gloss,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.450
a person who is gullible and
easy to take advantage of.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.165
And this sense of chump
is shared by nine words.

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:53.805
So we have chump one and fool two so

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:57.625
the second sense of fool and
the ninth sense of the word mark.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.345
And the first sense of
the word fall guy and so on.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:03.255
So each of these senses
has the same gloss,

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.985
now it's not every sense of those words,
so

00:02:04.985 --> 00:02:09.605
for example, gull has another sense,
sense two which is a kind of aquatic bird.

00:02:09.605 --> 00:02:13.570
So, a synset is a set of
near synonyms meaning

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.180
particular senses of words that
all have a similar meaning.

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:24.676
Now here's the WordNet
hypernym hierarchy for bass,

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:30.790
this is one sense of base, an adult
male singer with the lowest voice.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.140
And you see that a bass is a kind of
singer, which is a kind of musician,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.770
which is a kind of performer,
a kind of person,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.550
a kind of organism, all the way
up to physical entity and entity.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.710
So with the hypernym hierarchy
goes all they way to the top.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:49.615
Now WordNet has a lot of relations.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:55.965
We've talked about relations before,
so we have hypernyms and hyponyms.

00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:58.241
But WordNet also has
relationships like member.

00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:01.805
So, the relation has-member so for

00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:06.560
example a group like faculty
has members like professors.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.790
It has instances,
we talked about instances, so

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.980
the relationship between composers in
general and the one composer, Bach.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.662
Or, the one composer
Johann Sebastien Bach,

00:03:19.662 --> 00:03:21.663
of course there's more than one Bach.

00:03:21.663 --> 00:03:24.316
And then we have meronyms and holonyms, so

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:28.884
part-whole relationships between
individuals, so a table has a part,

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:33.210
which is a leg, and a course has
a part which is a meal and so on.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.740
So those are the relationships
between parts and whole.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.990
So lots of these relationships occur
in WordNet and antonomy as well.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.130
Now you can look on the web for WordNet.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.870
Now here it is.

00:03:48.173 --> 00:03:52.450
So we can look for the word bass or bass.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.822
And sure enough there it is,
there is our census of bass and

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:01.110
we can click on one of them.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.110
Let's click on one of the fish.

00:04:09.873 --> 00:04:15.140
There we go and now we can ask for
the whole set of inherited hypernyms.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:22.845
And there's a bass is a kind of freshwater
fish, a kind of seafood, a kind of food,

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:28.800
all the way up, again, all the way up
to down here To entity at the bottom.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.944
So here's the whole hypernym or
subordinate hierarchy.

00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:37.560
Now there are standard libraries for
accessing WordNet.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.760
There are Python libraries and

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.390
there are Java libraries and
we've given you some pointers here.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.340
Another important thesaurus or
anthology is MeSH,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.160
the Medical Subject Headings thesaurus
from the National Library of Medicine.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.110
So this has almost a couple
hundred thousand entries

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.120
corresponding to a lot of headings.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.510
So here's one, hemoglobin.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.150
It has a set of what
are called entry terms.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.990
Hemoglobin, Ferrous Hemoglobin.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.130
And I don't even know how
to pronounce that word.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.700
And these are the syns that
corresponds to the synsets in WordNet.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.360
This is the set of synonyms for
defining hemoglobins.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.580
And then we have a gloss as well.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.050
So here's the MeSH hierarchy here,
the top 16 top level categories.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.650
So we might want to look
inside one of them.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.550
Let's say chemicals and drugs, and

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.390
inside those,
we might want to look inside amino acids.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.990
And if we do that, we can look inside
proteins, and there's hemoglobins.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.530
So, there's the hierarchy for MeSH.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.900
And this ontology is used
to provide synonyms or

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.880
what are called entry terms
in the MeSH terminology.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.760
Provide hypernyms from the hierarchy
just like WordNet and MeSH is used for

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.530
indexing journal articles in
the National Library of Medicines,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.920
Bibliographic Database, MEDLINE PubMed
where there's 20 million journal articles,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.910
where the articles are hand-assigned 10 or
20 MeSH terms, so I'll use full ontology.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.570
So we've seen WordNet and MeSH,
two very commonly used thesauri or

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.780
ontologies, an important place to get
representations of word meaning and

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.460
word relations like hyponomy and synonomy.
