00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.830
Which knowledge can also be used in
modern question answering systems?

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.780
And the most commonly used form
of knowledge is relations.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.560
And so, relation extraction, which we
talked about in a previous lecture,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.590
is very important in question answering.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.560
And the relations can occur in
pulling out the answers, or

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.070
in analyzing the question, or in both.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.050
So, for example, we might have databases
of relations triple stores that we might

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.530
draw form Wikipedia info boxes, and might
be stored in places like DDP and freebase.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.190
And these various databases, and we can
learn facts like born in Emma Goldman,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.930
June 27, 1869 so
we can learn the birth date of somebody or

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.050
that Cao Xue Qin wrote Dream of
the Red Chamber, my favorite novel.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.130
So this author of relation,
this born in relation

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.340
are the kind of things that we may be
able to extract from these triple stores.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.930
To answer questions about
Emma Goldman's birth date or

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.170
the name of the author of
Dream of The Red Chamber.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.320
And doing that requires that we know
what relation was being asked for

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.820
in the question.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.840
And so we're going to need to also
extract relations from questions.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.830
So, if I ask a question whose
granddaughter starred in ET?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.690
I need to know that this question has
relations like some acted in ET and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.320
someone else has that
someone has a granddaughter.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.020
So these are just the kind of
relations that of we could extract

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.410
from both the question and

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.270
the answer then we can do some matching
on our triple stores and help find

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.890
the answer that's going to be used by most
of the modern question answering systems.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.160
Another kind of rich use of knowledge is
temporal reasoning from again from these

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.530
relation databases and also from
obituaries or biographical dictionaries.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.670
So a question that IBM sir Watson faced.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.690
In 1594, he took a job as a tax
collector in Andalusia and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.720
the candidate answers here are Thoreau and
Cervantes.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.480
And we'd like to know that
Thoreau is a very bad answer,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.670
because Thoreau was born in 1817, couldn't
have been alive in 1594 to take a job.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.630
But Cervantes is at least a possible
answer, because he was alive in 1594.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.110
So these kind of temporal databases
would let us do reasoning about

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.490
when people are born and died.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.930
And therefore, when they can be
an answer to a possible question.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.100
Geospatial knowledge questions about
containment, or directionality, or

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.955
borders, it can help answer lots of
questions so we can help know that Beijing

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:37.445
is a good answer for say, Asian city,
but New York is not a good answer for

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:41.225
Asian city or
that California is southwest of Montana.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:43.015
And so for example,

00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:47.815
one of these databases, geonames.org lets
you type in, I typed in Palo Alto here.

00:02:47.815 --> 00:02:51.230
And you can pull in all sorts of
facts from these kind of databases.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.050
So it's population,
it's elevation, the latitude and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.970
longitude and the fact that it's
part of the United States and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.420
part of California and
in Santa Clara County and so on.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.430
Many question answering systems are simply
one shot questions, you ask a question,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.980
you get an answer.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.550
Other systems like series one of these
carry on a full conversation with the user

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.770
and their contexting
conversation matters more.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.480
So for example, in a Siri conversation
you might say, book a table and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.020
Il Fornaio at 7:00 with my mom,
that might be sentence one.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.620
And sentence two might be,
also send her an email reminder.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.300
So that her knowing that her means my
mom is the kind of thing that matters if

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.320
you're going to have
multiple sentence questions.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.780
So, this conference resolving
dialogue conference knowing that her

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.150
refers to my mom is the kind of thing
we're going to need to do in a question

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.610
answering system if we have a full
conversation multiple sentences in a row.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.610
Similarly, you might be able to
ask clarification questions if

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.080
the user says Chicago pizza,
system like so you might ask,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.200
do you mean pizza restaurants in
Chicago or Chicago-style pizza?

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.320
So it might have an ambiguity.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.260
And the system resolves the ambiguity by
asking a follow-up question to the user.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.146
So these are the kind of complications
that occur when our questionnaire string

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:08.988
system has to be able to deal
with follow-on questions and

00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:10.100
dialogue in general.

00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:16.390
Knowledge like relation extraction is
very important question answering.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.980
And depending on a question
answering system,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.830
we're going to see other kinds of
knowledge like geospatial and temporal and

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.230
dialog and conversation knowledge
playing a role as well.
