00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.600
What is sentiment analysis?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.960
We discussed in a previous lecture that
deciding if a movie review was positive or

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.140
negative is an important
text classification task and

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.300
sentiment is a kind of
text classification.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.010
So deciding that
unbelievably disappointing

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.680
suggests that a movie was bad or
richly applied satire is probably good.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.970
Screwball comedy, good, pathetic, bad.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.430
This kind of sentiment can
also be applied to products.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.384
For example, Google Product Search
might want to, for a given product,

00:00:31.384 --> 00:00:35.750
like say this particular printer,
might want to automatically

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.590
extract facts about the printer and
sentiment for these facts.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.860
So these are called aspects or attributes.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.100
We like to automatically decide that
aspects or attributes of the printer,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.210
like its ease of use or customer service
are important aspects of the printer, and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.950
then automatically
determine the sentiments.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.200
We might want to say from sentences,
like this was very easy to setup, that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.680
most of the sentiment for this product for
this aspect, ease of use is positive.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.570
Perhaps for other kinds, other
aspects of this product like customer

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.800
service maybe we saw more negative
sentiment in reviews and less positive.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.190
So the task of reading all the reviews and
from each review noticing phrases

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.880
that suggest the sentiment and then
aggregating this sentiment overall reviews

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.910
the task of attribute or
aspect detection in sentiment analysis.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.740
And we can see this for
many other products, not just Google.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.420
So Bing has the same thing for
the same printer again.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.960
We can extract aspects like performance,
and ease of use, and print speed, and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.750
summarize from the various reviews
the positive and negative sentiment.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.130
Sentiment can also be applied
to things that aren't products.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.440
For example,
measuring consumer confidence.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.710
So this lovely graph from O'Connor,
et al, looks at sentiment

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.640
from Twitter tweets to try to predict
consumer confidence over time.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.310
And what they have shown
you in this blue line here

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.750
is sentiment as expressed in Twitter,
positive and negative sentiment, and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.100
in the black line,
you've got gallup poll data.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.730
And they show a pretty good correlation
here between Twitter sentiment and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.892
the Gallup poll, suggesting we can use
Twitter to measure public opinion.

00:02:32.892 --> 00:02:37.580
In fact, this kind of Twitter
sentiment has been shown to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.745
directly predict the stock market,
Bollen et al, from Twitter,

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:45.035
extracted things like calmness or
happiness,

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:49.165
various kinds of sentimental attributes
they could extract from Twitter.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:52.895
And then showed that those
attributes in particular,

00:02:54.495 --> 00:03:00.670
they showed that calmness predicts the Dow
Jones Industrial average three days later.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.980
So here's the Dow Jones average and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.130
here's their measure, the scored measure
of calmness they get from Twitter.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.398
And they show that by shifting
calm a little earlier that they

00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:18.371
have high predictions in these
regions of the Dow Jones.

00:03:20.428 --> 00:03:23.638
Twitter sentiment has
also been used simply to

00:03:23.638 --> 00:03:28.190
predict people's sentiment
toward brands in general.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.665
So here's the Twitter sentiment app.

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:38.905
A project by Alec Go and his colleagues
at Stanford who showed that you can take

00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:43.545
a query like United Airlines, look at all
the tweets mentioning United Airlines and

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.225
determine if they're positive.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.535
Here's positive down here, negative,
here's a couple of negative ones, or

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:55.150
neutral and
then summarize all of the sentiments.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.190
So people, at least when I ran
this query had some pretty

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.180
negative things to say about United,
more than they had positive things to say.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.979
So we can use Twitter to see in general
how people feel about all sorts of things.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.630
The task of sentiment analysis
is often called by other names.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.070
We call it opinion extraction, or
opinion mining, sentiment mining,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.610
subjectivity analysis,
lots of different names.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.880
And we're going to use this for all sorts
of tasks, so we've seen a lot of these.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.590
Are movies positive or negative?

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.380
What do people think about
products like some new iPhone?

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.370
In general,
can we measure public sentiment?

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.960
How is consumer confidence?

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.600
Are people in despair?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.110
What do people think about
particular candidates, or

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.040
particular issues in politics?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.370
And, in general once we can
measure people's sentiment,

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.170
can we use that to predict things,
market trends, election outcomes,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.120
anything we might want to predict?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.940
The psychologist
Klaus Scherer has shown that

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.400
there are lots of different
kinds of affective states.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.120
We're going to talk about sentiment
as really just one of many kinds of

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.440
affective states.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.020
So he talks about emotion.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.360
That's a brief kind of sentiment,
being angry or

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.500
being sad, mood, like being cheerful or
being depressed.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.620
And interpersonal stance,
how do I feel toward you?

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.080
I feel friendly,
I feel warm, I feel distant.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.590
Sentiment is a subtype of attitudes.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.880
Attitudes are my beliefs or dispositions
towards somebody so do I like something,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.200
do I love it, do I desire it,
do I value it?

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.670
And we can talk about very stable
things like personality traits.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.908
Am I an anxious person,
am I a hostile person, and so on.

00:05:32.908 --> 00:05:41.250
So sentiment is an attitude,
a kind of enduring,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.220
effectively colored belief or
disposition toward an object or person.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.440
And that definition suggests
the task of sentiment analysis.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.320
We're detecting attitudes, again I given
you the share of definition there.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.200
And we can talk about detecting
who has this attitude.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.640
The holder or source of the attitude.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.880
The target of the attitude or aspect.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.870
What is it that we have
this attitude about?

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.170
The type of attitude.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.740
So you can imagine from Scherer's list,
measuring liking, and loving, and hating,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.530
and diving, and desiring.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.100
Or a much more commonly,
a simple weighted polarity.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.860
Are we positively inclined toward this
target, negatively inclined, or neutral?

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.430
And we might have some strength value,
how positive and how negative.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.350
And we're going to do this from some text
which has the attitude, and we might

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.330
sometimes consider an entire document and
ask what's this whole document sentiment?

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.640
Or we might sometimes just look
at individual sentences and

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.520
say what is the sentiment
of this sentence?

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.800
So the simplest task, is the attitude of
some particular text positive or negative?

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.730
Slightly more complex tasks rate the
attitude of this text from one to five.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.610
So give not just a binary value, but
some kind of ordinal or numeric value.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.305
And more advanced sentiment
tasks detect the target,

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:07.535
detect the source, and
maybe detect more complex attitude types.

00:07:07.535 --> 00:07:10.941
So this simplest task is the attitude
of this text, positive or

00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:14.623
negative is the task that we're
going to spend the most time on today.
