00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.350
Okay, in this section of the course
we're going to start talking

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.010
about how to parse text
using statistical models.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.776
But before doing that, let me just
introduce two views of syntactic

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:15.640
structure that we'll explore
in our parsing models.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.090
So the first view is what's
called constituency parsing.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.730
And the idea of constituency
parsing is that what we do

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.040
is that we organize words
into nested constituents.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.698
Let me give you a bit
of an example of that.

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:35.878
So we had long ago this sentence,
Fed raises interest rates.

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:45.176
And so we had the parts of
speech that we've seen before,

00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:49.449
that this is a proper noun and
this a verb, and

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.980
these are both nouns in the sense
it's the correct parse.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.190
But then above that, what we wanted to say
is these nouns go together to form a noun

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.000
phrase, and then the verb and
the noun phrase go together to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.610
form a verb phrase, and everything
goes together to form a sentence.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.820
And so these things up here,
these are our constituents.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.075
And so the claim is that
the part of the sentence,

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:23.030
it's also sometimes shown with square
brackets, interest rates is a constituent,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.190
that it's a unit of the sentence.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.680
Now how do we know what a constituent is?

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.930
Well, that's a complex issue, but
here are some of the ideas that we use.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.980
So one big idea is by looking at
the words that stay together and go

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.360
together when phrases move around because
of various syntactic constructions.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.440
So in this example here,
we've got these two and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.020
three words, to the children and
about drugs.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.230
And well, something that you'll notice
is that we can actually swap them around

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.410
into the opposite order and
that that's fine.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.110
John talked about drugs to the children.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.280
Or you could do other things with them.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.694
So for example,
maybe you could take this one and

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:14.470
front it in certain discourse contexts.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.610
You could say,
to the children John talked about drugs.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.850
And so this is all evidence that each of
these groups of words is a constituent.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.400
On the other hand, if you randomly
reorder the words of a sentence,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.140
normally you get something
that just doesn't work at all.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.950
So here what I've tried to do
is take the word drugs from

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.980
the end here and thought, hm, maybe I can
just take it and stick it after taught.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.210
But that doesn't work at all.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.170
So you can't say, this is it down here,
John talked drugs to the children about.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.850
And there are a lot of other tests.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.220
Another test is this idea of
phrasal expansion and substitution.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.460
So for the phrase on the box
you can make it a bigger unit,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.730
like right on top of the box, and you
can make it a smaller unit, like there.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.170
And in general you can
apply these substitutions

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.700
in any place where the phrase
on the box can appear.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.398
There are lots of other syntactic tests
that people use for constituency.

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:20.022
Really, if you want to learn a lot about
this you should take a linguistics course

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:22.225
and then you'll see this
all in more detail.

00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:24.920
But I hope that's enough
to give a rough idea.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.158
Those were simple sentences.

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:30.830
This is the kind of thing that happens
when you've got big real sentences.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.190
So this sentence is, Analysts said Mr.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.480
Stronach wants to resume a more
influential role in running the company.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.060
And so the idea of constituency structure,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.140
or phrase structure, is that we have this
units, again, that are constituents.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.178
So here's a constituent,
a more influential role.

00:03:50.178 --> 00:03:54.257
Here's another constituent which
just is name Mr. Stronach.

00:03:54.257 --> 00:03:57.090
And then here are some different
constituents down the bottom.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.790
So running the company is a constituent.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.170
But also this bigger in running
the company is also a constituent.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.720
So constituents nest together.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.712
And these are the kind of parse trees
that NLP people actually spend their time

00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:12.608
dealing with.

00:04:12.608 --> 00:04:14.720
And we'll talk more about these, but

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.143
note just one attribute of them is as
well as actual pronounced words, they're

00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:23.648
postulating these unpronounced units
in them as well, called empty elements.

00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:31.327
So the straightforward way to model phrase
structural constituency structures, just

00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:37.390
as a context-free grammar, which we assume
you've seen somewhere in computer science.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.061
And that is just the idea that
you've got these rules that says,

00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:45.050
A rewrites as B C D.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.990
And if you apply these,
then let's say we have B goes to E F.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.996
If you apply these,
you get phrase structure rules,

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:59.568
where this is B, C, D and
then this goes to E, F.

00:04:59.568 --> 00:05:03.150
And that gives you
the constituency structure.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.360
But these kind of rules you can write for
other tree symbols.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.080
But if you actually look at what
happens in natural languages,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.460
there's always a lot more structure.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.730
And this is the idea that
gets called X-bar theory.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.670
And what that says is that
in natural languages, by and

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.550
large, phrases are headed by particular

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.280
kinds of words which then take
modifiers and dependents around them.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.910
So informally we call things a verb
phrase precisely because they have

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.798
a verb in the middle of them.

00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:41.296
And we call things a noun phrase precisely
because they have a noun that is

00:05:41.296 --> 00:05:43.590
the central element of them.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.900
So a noun phrase,
something like the man in the corner,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.140
centrally has the noun man and then
has other modifiers sitting around it.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.001
And so although according
to a context-free grammar,

00:05:57.001 --> 00:06:01.845
these are just arbitrary symbols,
in practice we give them names that

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.558
reflect this headed structure or
phrase structure.

00:06:05.558 --> 00:06:09.600
And the same is true of other categories,
as well, like adjective phrases and

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.529
adverb phrases.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.520
So they are a large part
of our category inventory.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.230
We do have other kinds of phrases.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.438
So we have sentences and
various kinds of invert and questioning

00:06:22.438 --> 00:06:29.320
sentences which basically correspond to
a subject noun phrase and a verb phrase.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.023
And then they can appear in bigger
complement clauses, these SBAR and

00:06:34.023 --> 00:06:39.400
SBAR(Q), which also have something
like a that introducing the sentence.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.640
And various other miscellaneous
stuff happens as well.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.820
Again, you can learn a lot more about
that in a linguistic syntax class.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.770
But this idea of headed phrase structure
is the connection between phrase structure

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.100
and the other big approach to syntactic
structure that I want to show you, and

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.350
that's dependency structure.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:05.900
So in dependency structure, the idea is we
directly show for the words of a sentence

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.310
which other words depend on, that is,
modify or are arguments of, them.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.640
Let's look at that with this example,
the boy put the tortoise on the rug.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.817
So the head of this whole
sentence is putting,

00:07:19.817 --> 00:07:23.520
that that's the central
word of the sentence.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.480
And that's sometimes represented
by having a dependency arc coming

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.938
in from the edge, pointing to
the head of the whole sentence.

00:07:32.938 --> 00:07:36.258
Okay, so
then put has two arguments itself.

00:07:36.258 --> 00:07:39.938
So put's arguments are the boy.

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:44.161
I'm sorry,
it's got three arguments itself,

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:48.798
the tortoise, and on the rug,
where things are put.

00:07:48.798 --> 00:07:54.778
So who put what and then where.

00:07:54.778 --> 00:07:58.511
Okay, and so then at that point,
we then sort of say, well, boy,

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.870
does it have any modifiers or arguments?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.050
Its modifier is the.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.368
Tortoise, does it have any modifiers or
arguments?

00:08:05.368 --> 00:08:08.410
Its modifier is the.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.878
And then on, as a preposition,
takes a complement, so

00:08:12.878 --> 00:08:16.110
its argument is its complement the rug,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.270
where the rug is the head and
the modifier of rug is the.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.702
And so
this set of arrows I've now drawn here is

00:08:24.702 --> 00:08:27.788
a dependency analysis of this sentence.

00:08:27.788 --> 00:08:32.189
And this form of dependency
analysis is the other major

00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:35.448
syntactic representation we'll use.

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:35.996
Okay, so

00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:40.585
I hope that's been enough to give you some
idea of the representations we use for

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:45.330
syntactic structure and how the two main
representations connect to each other.
