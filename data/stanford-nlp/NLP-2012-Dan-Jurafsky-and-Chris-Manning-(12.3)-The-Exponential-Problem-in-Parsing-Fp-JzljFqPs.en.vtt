00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.150
In this segment I'm going to talk about
where the huge number of parses for

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.020
human languages sentences comes from and

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.750
how we might go about solving it
in our statistical parsing system.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.710
So a key part of doing parsing for
human language sentences is

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.830
this problem of what's called attachment
from the psychological literature.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.760
It's for various kinds of phrases,
how do we decide what they modify?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.940
So anytime we have prepositional phrases,
adverbial or

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.350
participial phrases, infinitives,
coordinations, and things like that,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.720
we have this attachment decision of
working out what are they modifying.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.740
Let's work through an example
to get an idea of that problem.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.413
So here we have a sentence,
The board approved [its acquisition] [by

00:00:54.413 --> 00:01:00.260
Royal Trustco Ltd.] [of Toronto] [for
$27 a share] [at its monthly meeting].

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.630
And if we look at this sentence,
well, what do we find?

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.700
We find that, well,
we have here the subject,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.460
the board, then the verb approved,
and object its acquisition.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.140
But then if we look after that, what
we find is that there are actually four

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.130
prepositional phrases in a row,
by Royal Trustco Ltd of Toronto for

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.045
$27 a share at its monthly meeting.

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:34.220
And for each of those what we need to
do is decide what are they modifying.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.580
So in general,
a prepositional phrase can modify a verb.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.632
It can modify a preceding noun phrase,
so it's got these two targets.

00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:50.540
But actually, each of these prepositional
phrases includes in it a noun phrase.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.400
So once we get to the later
prepositional phrases,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.820
there'll be more things that
each one can choose to modify.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.540
Okay, let's go through each one in turn.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.520
Right, so for by Royal Trustco,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.950
that's modifying the acquisition,
not the approval.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.600
So its acquisition by Royal Trustco.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.890
So that's in dependency format,
we have that relationship.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.050
Okay, of Toronto, this is not modifying
the approval or the acquisition.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.090
Rather, it's Royal Trustco Ltd of Toronto.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.029
So this prepositional phrase is
modifying Royal Trustco Ltd.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:40.082
Okay, so then if we go on to
the third one, for $27 a share,

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:44.182
that's not modifying Toronto or
Royal Trustco.

00:02:44.182 --> 00:02:47.420
It's modifying the acquisition.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.966
So this is an acquisition for $27 a share.

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:56.241
And then for the last prepositional
phrase, at its monthly meeting,

00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:01.096
that's presumably not referring to
an acquisition at its monthly meeting, or

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:05.750
any of these other things, but rather
its approval at its monthly meeting.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.600
So this prepositional phrase
modifies the first verb.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.260
Okay, that was kind of complex,
though as human beings,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.440
we just read the sentence and
understand what it means,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.740
and do these attachment decisions without
any apparent effort most of the time.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.183
But the thing we want to think about for

00:03:27.183 --> 00:03:32.357
a moment now is how many
possible attachments there are.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:36.681
Well, if you just sort of
think there are 1, 2, 3,

00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:41.854
4 things here and each of them can
attach to a bunch of points, and

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:48.157
each one can be chosen completely freely,
it should be fairly clear that well,

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:52.862
we're going to get exponential
number of possibilities,

00:03:52.862 --> 00:03:57.610
exponential in the number
of prepositional phrases.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.305
And it's precisely from that cause
is where this huge number of

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:07.170
parses that we saw previously, like having
600 parses for a sentence, came from.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.995
Then really you're making
a number of decisions for

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:13.335
things like category and attachment.

00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:16.148
And a lot of them can
fairly freely combine, so

00:04:16.148 --> 00:04:20.535
you multiply out these ambiguities and
you get a huge number.

00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:23.850
However, it's not the case
in examples like this

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.520
you're completely free to
attach anything anywhere.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.392
So when we did by Royal Trustco,
it could certainly choose to

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:37.040
attach either to the preceding noun or
the verb.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.880
And then syntactically when we attached
of Toronto, it had three choices.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.410
It could attach to Royal Trustco or

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.560
to the preceding noun phrase or
to the preceding verb phrase.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.880
And all of those were
syntactically possible.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.000
But once you've made
some higher attachments,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.630
that means earlier in the sentence,
things become more restricted.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.113
So in particular,
once we decided to attach for

00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:15.680
$27 a share as a modifier
of its acquisition,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.596
that restricts the attachments that are
possible for this prepositional phrase.

00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:24.960
It could still attach to a share, or

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.160
it could attach to an acquisition,
or it could attach to approved.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.256
But these ones here that are kind of
hidden behind the attachment of for

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:43.440
$27 a share to an acquisition,
these ones become not possible anymore.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.620
So that leaves kind of
a little puzzle of well,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.130
as you add on prepositional
phrase attachments to a sentence,

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.330
how many possible attachments are there
that observe this constraint,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.050
which corresponds to
dependencies not crossing or for

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.340
there being a tree structure to
a sentence in a phrase structure grammar?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.070
Well, it turns out
the the answer to that question

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.110
is a well-worked-out piece of math.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.880
The answer can be found in the series of
Catalan numbers, which is a sequence that

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.870
turns up in a lot of places, wherever
you've got kind of tree-like context.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.550
For example, it even turns up in
probabilistic graphical models.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.390
An the important thing to know
from our purposes is that

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.360
the growth of the Catalan numbers
is still an exponential sequence.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.819
We get an exponential number of parses.

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.044
Unless you're a math geek,
working through the factorials

00:06:39.044 --> 00:06:41.833
there probably isn't the most
useful things to do.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:45.698
But rather it's probably much
more valuable linguistically to

00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:50.204
actually look at what are the possible
structures for a simple sentence and

00:06:50.204 --> 00:06:52.850
get a sense of how many there are there.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.020
And so that's what we'll ask you to do
in the quiz question that follows this.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.590
Okay, you've hopefully worked out in the
quiz that the answer that once you have

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.490
two prepositional phrases,
the number of possible structures is five.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.580
But rather than focusing
on that number now,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.270
what I want to start doing is focusing
on the two problems that come from

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.970
having this exponential possible number
of parses to even quite simple sentences.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.040
So problem number one is that
if we parse naively, and

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.110
that means that we use
the simple kinds of top-down or

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.810
bottom-up parses that are normally
used in context, like in programming

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.707
languages where they're used
with less ambiguous languages.

00:07:41.707 --> 00:07:46.161
But that would mean that our parsers end
up doing an exponential amount of work

00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:51.070
themselves, and that's no good if we'd
like our parsers to parse quickly.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.250
So where does that exponential
amount of work come from?

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.980
Well, the thing to notice is that we're
generating this exponential number

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.740
of trees, and that comes about from having
a small number of basic ambiguities.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:13.100
So in this silly example, we have
the two PPs with cats and with claws.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.471
We're choosing where to
attach each of those.

00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:19.023
So there are really only two decisions,

00:08:19.023 --> 00:08:24.570
but we're then multiplying that out
into an exponential number of parses.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.100
And in the course of doing that,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.910
what happens is that we do
a lot of repeated work.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:35.010
So if you look at these parse structures,
you can see that we keep on building

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.560
the same piece of structure over and
over again.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.990
So here's a little PP of with claws.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:47.010
And we build it in this parse, we build it
in that parse, we build it in that parse,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.470
we build it in every parse.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.040
We're always going to have that PP.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.973
But if we just generate all the structures
we're building it over and over again.

00:08:56.973 --> 00:08:59.570
And the same is true with
larger bits of structures.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.335
So here's a bigger PP,
with cats with claws.

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:07.500
It also appears in this parse, and so

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.780
we are doing completely duplicated
work there, and that goes on.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.990
So here's a verb phrase
of scratch people and

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:22.370
we generate it in that parse and
we generate it in that parse.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.460
And there are other
places in which we build

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.032
other pieces of structure
that get repeated over.

00:09:29.032 --> 00:09:33.150
So here's a noun phrase
of people with cats and

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:39.190
here's the same piece of noun
phrase of people with cats.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:45.860
Here is a verb phrase of
scratch people with cats.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.710
And here is again the verb
phrase scratch people with cats

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.850
being generated a second time.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.585
So there's just a lot of repeated work.

00:09:57.585 --> 00:10:01.790
And so the secret to building efficient
parsers and getting away from doing

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:08.035
an exponential amount of work is to
avoid doing the same work twice.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:14.155
We only want to find possible pieces of
structure for a sentence precisely once.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:19.090
And then we'll be able to turn parsing
from an exponential problem into

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.073
a polynomial time problem.

00:10:21.073 --> 00:10:26.213
The problem is then how to choose the
correct parse, or several likely parses,

00:10:26.213 --> 00:10:29.757
out of the many,
many possible parses for a sentence.

00:10:29.757 --> 00:10:31.580
How can we do that?

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.410
Well, let's look at this simple example.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.670
So this is again the classic here is
a verb with an object noun phrase and

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.700
a prepositional phrase
attachment following it.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.130
So it could be that this
modifies the verb so

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:50.560
she is looking through a telescope and
she saw the man with the telescope.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.110
Or it could be that this
modifies the noun, so

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.960
this is a man with a telescope and
she saw that person.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.450
Well, which of those is correct?

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.350
Well, the answer is that
it could be either.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.470
So this is what's commonly referred
to as an AI complete problem.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:12.790
Knowing which is correct could depend
on arbitrary knowledge about the world

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.240
situation that's being observed or
the prior discourse context in really

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.210
complex ways, and
it can be really hard to tell.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:26.570
Well, that's true, but it turns out that
in a lot of cases you can be pretty sure

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.970
what's correct without
understanding a lot.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.240
That just looking at the words that
are involved, the nouns, the verbs, and

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.710
the prepositions, you can get a really
good idea of which attachment is correct,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.495
even without having anything like
full understanding of the sentence.

00:11:42.495 --> 00:11:45.525
Let's look at a couple of
examples that illustrate this.

00:11:47.295 --> 00:11:51.345
Okay, so
here is now some more real text examples.

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:53.115
They have exactly the same structure.

00:11:53.115 --> 00:11:58.387
So we've got a verb, a noun phrase,
and our prepositional phrase.

00:11:58.387 --> 00:12:02.467
Moscow sent more than 100,000
soldiers into Afghanistan.

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:08.810
So one possibility is that the sending is
into Afghanistan, the verb attachment.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.639
And the other possibility is
it's soldiers into Afghanistan.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.580
Now syntactically,
either of these is possible.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.603
So soldiers into Afghanistan,
would have the same structure

00:12:20.603 --> 00:12:26.797
as a phrase like whatever student's
into Lady Gaga or something like that.

00:12:26.797 --> 00:12:30.239
All right, it's a possible syntactic
structure, but it's just really,

00:12:30.239 --> 00:12:31.116
really unlikely.

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:34.994
You're just very unlikely to
have soldiers into Afghanistan.

00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:39.939
And so almost certainly the structure
that we want to choose is with

00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:42.627
into Afghanistan modifying sent.

00:12:42.627 --> 00:12:49.550
And that's a very common idiom, that you
send something into some environment,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.330
and so we should choose this parse.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.440
And then let's look at this next example.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.180
So in this example, same structure again.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:07.570
And we can have the PP with
New South Wales head being

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.880
a dependent of breached,
breached with New South Wales Health.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.910
Or it can be a dependent of the agreement,
agreement with New South Wales head.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:22.190
Well, again, breaching with New South
Wales here just isn't very likely.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.065
You just don't say I
breached with my friend.

00:13:26.065 --> 00:13:27.930
It doesn't sound very good.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.830
On the other hand,
an agreement with New South Wales Health,

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:38.430
that's really common and normal sounding,
because you make agreements with somebody.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.821
And so this is the attachment
that we should choose.

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:48.700
So that then didn't look that hard,
and that's exactly what we'll do.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.980
Our statistical parsers will try and

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.790
exploit such statistics about word
combination, which kind of preposition

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.640
is likely to go with which nouns and
which verbs, to be able to choose

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.680
the correct parses of sentences without
having full understanding of them.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.800
Okay, I hope that's given
a sense of how parsing

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.350
human language sentences can
just be a really bad problem.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.600
But also some idea of how we
can start developing methods

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.990
that will solve both the problem of there
being an exponential number of parses,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.410
not causing an exponential amount of work,
and

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.311
how we choose the most likely parses for
sentences.
