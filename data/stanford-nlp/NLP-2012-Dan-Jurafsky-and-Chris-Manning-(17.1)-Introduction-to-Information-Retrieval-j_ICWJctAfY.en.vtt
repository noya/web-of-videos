00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.060
Hello, in this segment I'm going to
introduce the task of information

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.810
retrieval including in particular what's
now the dominant form, web search.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.780
The task of information retrieval

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.995
can be maybe defined as follows
that our goal is finding material,

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:23.970
which is usually documents of
an unstructured nature, usually text that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.082
satisfies an information need,
that's what the person is looking for

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:34.152
information on from within large
collections, usually stored on computers.

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:38.772
So there's lots of mentions
there of prototypical cases, and

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.686
other kinds of information retrieval
do exist, so that things like

00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:47.196
music information retrieval, where
there are sounds, not text documents.

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:49.706
But effectively what we're
going to talk about here

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:53.326
is the case where all of
those usually falls as hold.

00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:56.266
There are many scenarios for
information retrieval.

00:00:56.266 --> 00:01:00.416
The one that people think of first these
days is almost unbearably web search.

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:01.926
But there are many others,

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:06.600
so searching your email, searching
the contents of your laptop computer,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.930
finding stuff in some company's knowledge
base, doing legal information retrieval to

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.180
find relevant cases from legal context or
something like that.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.220
It's always been the case the large
percentage of human knowledge and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.150
information is stored in the full
of human language documents.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.770
And yet, there's also for a long time
been something of a paradox there.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.550
So, this is just a kind of not quite
real graph to give a flavor of things.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.790
Don't really believe the numbers on the
left hand side or exactly what they mean.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.650
But what we're showing is
that in the mid 1990s,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.700
it was already the case that if
you looked at the volume of data,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.510
that there was some data that
was in structured forms.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.312
By that I mean things like relational
databases and spreadsheets, but

00:01:56.312 --> 00:02:00.650
there was already vastly more data in
companies, organizations, and around

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.300
people's homes that was in unstructured
form, in the form of human language text.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.810
However despite that, in the mid 1990s,
structured data management and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.260
retrieval was a developed field in
their already large database companies,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.440
where in the field of unstructured
data management there was very little.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.800
There are a few teeny little
companies that did various kinds

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.500
of corporate document retrieval and
things like that.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.650
That situation just completely changed
around the turn of the millennium.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.670
So if we look today,
the situation is like this, so the data

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.360
volumes have gotten larger on both sides,
but in particular they've gotten larger on

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.470
the unstructured side with the massive
outpouring of blogs, tweets, forums,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.050
and all those other places that now
store massive amounts of information.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.730
But, there's also then been
a turnaround on the corporate side.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.839
So now we have huge companies that
are addressing the problems of

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:03.650
unstructured information retrieval
such as the major web search giants.

00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:11.101
So let's start and just say a little
bit about what is the basic framework

00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:13.880
of doing information retrieval?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.310
So we start off by assuming
that we've got a collection

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.010
of documents over which
we're going to do retrieval.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.680
And at the moment we're going to assume
that it's just a static collection.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.110
Later on we'll deal with when
documents get added to and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.840
deleted from that collection, and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.900
how we can go out and find them in
something like a web search scenario.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.945
Then our goal is to retrieve
documents that are relevant

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:41.225
to the user's information need and
helps the user complete a task.

00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:46.275
Let me go through that once more a little
bit more slowly with this picture.

00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:55.250
So at the start, what we have is the user
has some task that they want to perform.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.990
Let's take a concrete example.

00:03:59.394 --> 00:04:04.730
Suppose what I want to do is get rid
of the mice that are in my garage.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.090
And I'm the kind of person that doesn't
really want to kill them with poison.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.620
So that's my user task
that I want to achieve.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.090
And so to achieve that task,
I feel that I need more information.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.390
And so this is the information need.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.350
I want to know about getting rid
of mice without killing them.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.040
This information need is the thing with
respect of which we assess in information

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.400
retrieval system but we can't just
take someone's information need and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.970
stick it straight into a computer.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.800
So what we have to do to be able
to stick it into a computer

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.040
is to translate the information need into
something that goes into the search box.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.330
And so, that's what's happened here.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.660
We now have a query, and so here's my
attempt at a query, how trap mice alive.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.420
So that's taken this information need and

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.900
I've made an attempt to realize
that as a particular query.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.736
And so then it's that query that goes
into the search engine which leads, which

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:10.524
then interrogates our document collection
and leads to some results coming back.

00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:14.720
And that may be the end of the day but
sometimes if I am not satisfied

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.060
with how my information retrieval
session is working I might take

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.590
the evidence I got from there and
go back and come up with a better query.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.906
So I might decide that alive is a bad word
and put in something like without killing.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.599
And see if that works any better.

00:05:38.407 --> 00:05:41.040
Okay, what can go wrong here?

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.830
Well, there are a couple of
stages of interpretation here.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.412
So first of all,
there was my initial task and

00:05:51.412 --> 00:05:55.910
I had made some decisions as to what
kind of information need I had.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.300
It could be that I got
something wrong there.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.030
So I could have a misconception.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.460
So maybe in getting rid of mice the most

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.950
important issue is not whether or not I
kill them but whether I do it humanely.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.560
But we're not going to deal with that
issue so much, what we're more interested

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.660
in here is the translation between
the information need and the query.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.610
And there are lots of ways
in which that can go wrong

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.670
in misformulation of the query.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.650
So I might choose the wrong words to
express the query, I might make use of

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.690
query search operators like inverted
commas which might have a good or

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.530
bad effect on how the query actually
works, and so those are choices in my

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.890
query formulation which aren't altering
my information need whatsoever.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.500
That's important when we talk about how to
evaluate information retrieval systems.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.280
That's a topic we'll say more about later,
but let me just give you the first rough

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.400
sense of this because we'll need it for
everything that we do.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.053
So whenever we make a query to an
information retrieval system we're going

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:06.020
to get some documents back, and we want
to know whether the results are good.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.530
And the very basic way in which
we're going to see whether they

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.320
are good is as follows.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.760
We're going to think of two
measures which are complementary,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.670
one of which is precision.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.020
So precision is the fraction of
the retrieved documents in the system

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.880
that are relevant to
the user's information needs.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.890
So that's whether when you look at the
results it seems like one document in ten

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.430
is relevant to the information
need you have or

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.760
whether seven documents in ten are.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.630
That's assessing whether the mix of
stuff you are getting back has a lot of

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.450
bad results in it.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.810
The complementary mixture
measure is the one of recall.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.940
Recall is measuring how much of the good
information that's in the document

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.150
collection is the system succeeding and
finding for

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.480
you at the fraction of relevant docs
in the collection that are retrieved.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.860
We'll give more precise definitions and
measurements for

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.830
information retrieval later.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.421
But the one thing I want to express right
now is that for these measures to make

00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:11.400
sense they have to be evaluated with
respect to the user's information need.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.730
For certain kinds of queries,

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.060
such as the ones we'll look at in the
following segments the documents that get

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.900
returned are deterministic in
terms of what query is submitted.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.560
So if we were just going to evaluate
what gets returned with respect to

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.750
the user's query, then we'd necessarily
say that the precision is 100%.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:34.920
But that's not what we do.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.000
What we do is think about
the user's information need and

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.790
the precision of the results
is assessed relative to that.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.535
So in particular, if we just look back for
a moment, if there's being

00:08:48.535 --> 00:08:54.210
a misformulation of the query by the user,
or just they didn't come up with a very

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:59.150
good query, that will be seen as lowering
the precision of the return results.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.370
Okay, this is only the very beginning of
our looking at information retrieval.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.010
But I hope you've already
got a sense of how we

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.950
think of the task of
information retrieval and

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.280
roughly how we can see whether a search
engine is doing a good or a bad job on it.
