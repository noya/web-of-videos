# Web of videos #
## Overview ##
One of the most popular websites for hosting videos is youtube. Institutions have made tremendous contributions in making high quality educational videos available to anyone. 
However these information still remains somewhat scattered. Youtube is good at suggesting videos of the same genre, however for educational purpose videos it still lacks a more fine graned content matching in order to supplement the currently playing video

The project aims to realize a prototype of "web of videos." It will link to other videos of similar content to the currently playing video.
Moreover, instead of finding similar videos for the entire video, it will suggest similar videos for each video segment. 
It also annotates each similar video with descriptions to help the user select the most relevent link
If a link description is not available it will simply display "None"

## Usage ##
Use University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign's videos to find other similar videos. The match is done per video basis.
